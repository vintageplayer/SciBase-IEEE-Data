In this study, a novel method for estimating the rotating angular velocity of the targets with dominant scatters is proposed. The range cells where the amplitudes have smaller normalised variances are selected, and then frequency domain windowing is applied to extract echoes of dominant scatters.

Then, a new method is developed under the kernel density estimation (KDE) framework to estimate the spatial intensity of false alarms for the multitarget tracking problem. In the proposed method, the false alarm spatial intensity estimation problem is decomposed into two subproblems: (i) estimating the number of false alarms in one scan and (ii) estimating the variation of the intensity function value in the measurement space. Under the NHPP assumption, the only parameter that needs to be estimated for the first subproblem is the mean of false alarm number, and the empirical mean is used here as the maximum likelihood estimate of that parameter.

In contrast to the existing parametric STAP detectors, the proposed detectors perform range estimation by exploiting the spillover of the target energy between consecutive samples. To this end, the authors assume that the received useful signal is known up to a complex unknown deterministic factor parameter and the disturbance signal is modelled as a multichannel autoregressive Gaussian process. Moreover, the authors assume that a set of secondary data is available which are free of signal components, but have the same unknown parameters as the disturbance in the cells under test. Using these assumptions, the so-called simplified generalised likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and the two-step GLRT are derived and assessed. It is worth noting that the simplified GLRT is based on an asymptotic ML estimate of the amplitude, which leads to a simple and closed-form detection statistic. The performance assessment, conducted resorting to both simulated dataset and KASSPER dataset, has shown that the proposed decision schemes can provide accurate estimates of the target position within the cell under test and ensure enhanced detection performance compared with their natural competitors.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Parametric space&#8211;time detection and range estimation of a small target"}, "arnumber": "7046027", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:53", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/7046026/7046027", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "226KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7447710", "documentLink": "/document/7447710"}, "displayText": "Weijian Liu, Jun Liu, Xiaoqin Hu, Zhikai Tang, Lei Huang, Yong-Liang Wang, \"Statistical Performance Analysis of the Adaptive Orthogonal Rejection Detector\", <em>Signal Processing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 23, pp. 873-877, 2016, ISSN 1070-9908.", "title": "Statistical Performance Analysis of the Adaptive Orthogonal Rejection Detector", "order": "1"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.037414S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Parametric space&#8211;time detection and range estimation of a small target", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Parametric space&#8211;time detection and range estimation of a small target"}}, "Article 4": {"details": {"issue": "2", "volume": "9", "authors": [{"name": "Jos&#233;-Mar&#237;a Mu&#241;oz-Ferreras", "affiliation": "University of Alcal\u00e1 (UAH), Spain"}, {"name": "Guochao Wang", "affiliation": "Texas Tech University (TTU), USA"}, {"name": "Changzhi Li", "affiliation": "Texas Tech University (TTU), USA"}, {"name": "Roberto G&#243;mez-Garc&#237;a", "affiliation": "University of Alcal\u00e1 (UAH), Spain"}], "keywords": [{"kwd": ["high-pass filters", "CW radar", "FM radar", "frequency modulation"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["stationary clutter", "clutter-mitigation procedure", "Doppler high-pass filtering technique", "healthcare LFMCW radars", "advantageous range-isolation capability", "phase based range precision", "pure linear-frequency-modulated continuous-wave radars", "vital-sign monitoring"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2014.0106", "publisher": "IET", "abstract": "Stationary clutter can seriously degrade the performance of radar sensors.

Radar offers privacy and non-intrusive monitoring capabilities. Micro-Doppler signatures are typically employed for radar-based human motion detections and classifications. Proper time-frequency signal representation is, therefore, required from which important features can be extracted.

The detection of multiple human body landmarks is achieved by moving target indication and a new out-of-band constant false alarm rate detection, and the multiple landmark tracking is accomplished by a novel iterative convex optimisation-based approach with considerations of biomechanical constraints. The data association technique is then applied to validate and relate the detection results to target landmarks for generating range measurements, which are used for a convex optimisation-based sequential estimation algorithm to estimate the accurate marker locations. It is noted that the proposed optimisation-based sequential estimation is able to incorporate biomechanical constraints. In the field experiments, two radio frequency reflectors are attached to the wrist and the elbow of one human arm.

A main dual-band radiator with a slotted patch is used as the basis for the antenna design: the patch resonates at 2.45 GHz whereas the antenna slot enables a wide band operation for the radar system.

It works as a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) plane from 6 to 7.5 GHz and can be located close to the slot antenna functioning as a reflector.

The first step determines the length of each segment depending on number of good quality scatterers and motion errors obtained from navigation data. In the second step, a novel minimum-entropy phase correction based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients is proposed. In this approach, transform phase error estimated by PGA to DCT-coefficients that represent the phase error in the frequency or time-frequency domain. The entropy of a focused image is utilised as the optimisation function of the DCT-coefficients to improve the final image quality.

One efficient way to accomplish maritime border protection is to use the netted forward scatter radar (FSR). FSR is a special type of bistatic radar that operates in a relatively narrow scattering area along the transmitter-receiver baseline, where the effect of the electromagnetic waves forward scattering on targets is dominant above other scattering mechanisms, and in this case, a forward scatter (FS) cross section may increase by orders of magnitude in comparison with the monostatic radar cross section (RCS). Considered in this study are the major problems of marine forward scattering radar detection and estimation of length of low-profile (small and slow) marine targets using a pre-processing approach. It is based on the assumption that the variation of the phase and amplitude in the Doppler signal signature is stronger inside the FS zone than in an outside region. Two variants of pre-processing algorithms are presented in the study, one for the envelope and the other for the phase. Both variants are based on the use the local variance filtering. The results obtained prove the sufficient improvement in a signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). Estimation of the marine target length under the low SCR is designed using the assumption of known or previously estimated velocity. Presented results demonstrate high accuracy of length estimation. Considered steps of targets detection and target attributes evaluations are necessary for maritime targets classification.

In this study, an effective 3D ISAR imaging algorithm for turntable model based on compressive sensing is proposed, which exploits the sparsity in the image domain to achieve 3D reconstruction by using a limited number of measurements. Firstly, the 3D data tensor is converted into a 2D matrix by stacking slices of data along one specific dimension; then a 2D optimisation reconstruction approach is applied to solve a sparsity-driven optimisation problem to obtain the 2D distribution of the scatterers. Lastly, 3D ISAR images are generated by rearranging the scatterer distribution in the 2D map into a 3D volume. This imaging scheme only needs a small number of measurements, and reduces the required memory and computational burden significantly.

However, the degradation of conventional algorithms for reconstructing the Doppler spectrum with special pulse repetition frequency (PRF) shows poor robustness and the out-of-band energy which is caused by the side lobes of the antenna pattern deteriorates the azimuth ambiguity to signal ratio of a multichannel SAR. In this study, an improved reconstruction algorithm based on antenna pattern is proposed by generating an ambiguity matrix, which resembles the covariance matrix and could be used to reconstruct in-band signal and minimise the azimuth ambiguity energy.

The authors propose a method for preprocessing sidescan sonar data for visualisation, detection and classification purposes. Sidescan imagery is highly sensor specific and is typically affected by factors that have either a range dependency or an angular dependency. Each of these is altered in a different way given variations in sensor altitude over the seabed. Working from the physics and geometry of the sonar process, the proposed method estimates separate correction factors for range and angular dependencies directly from the image data. Once calculated, these factors can be applied over large data sets to provide radiometric correction over the entire survey area. Simpler image processing algorithms are more effective because the image statistics are improved with more stable means and variances across the sonar swath. The method requires a good bottom detection algorithm for estimation of sensor altitude at each transmission time and incorporates a resampling scheme for the calculation and application of the angular-dependency correction factors.

The five criteria are Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Hannan and Quinn Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Corrected AIC (AlCc) and the recently introduced Vector Corrected Kullback Information Criterion (KICvc) and Weighted-Average Information Criterion (WIC). The general form of the above information criteria consists of a log likelihood function expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix and a unique penalty term. In our estimation procedure, the number of signals is obtained by minimising each of the above criteria. Several simulated data sets, including a linear antenna array data set, are adopted for the comparison purpose. The authors show that, in simple MUSIC additive white noise model, for small sample size n, WIC performs nearly as well as AlCc and outperforms other criteria, and for moderately large to large n, WIC performs nearly as well as BIC and outperforms other criteria. Therefore when the authors are not certain of the relative sample size, WIC may be a practical alternative to any criterion. The main purpose is to draw the attention and interests of signal processing researchers to adopt more recent statistical model selection criteria, such as WIC, in general signal processing problems.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "A comparative study of model selection criteria for the number of signals"}, "arnumber": "4509478", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:01:04", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4509475/4509478", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "2285KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4814547", "documentLink": "/document/4814547"}, "displayText": "Reinhard Feger, Christoph Wagner, Stefan Schuster, Stefan Scheiblhofer, Herbert Jager, Andreas Stelzer, \"A 77-GHz FMCW MIMO Radar Based on an SiGe Single-Chip Transceiver\", <em>Microwave Theory and Techniques IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 57, pp. 1020-1035, 2009, ISSN 0018-9480.", "title": "A 77-GHz FMCW MIMO Radar Based on an SiGe Single-Chip Transceiver", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2234KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6384817", "documentLink": "/document/6384817"}, "displayText": "Zhihua Lu, Abdelhak M.

An algorithm based on the delineation of shadows using active contours constrained by a simple wire-frame building model has been developed and demonstrated using SAR imagery of a village on Salisbury plain. The core of the algorithm is a novel technique for target delineation involving multiple active contours evolving simultaneously. In particular, a technique referred to as multiple hypothesis delineation, in which contours can be in several states simultaneously, is developed and shown to lead to considerable improvement in convergence time and delineation accuracy when used to delineate multiple targets in close proximity. The technique is applied to the automatic estimation of building dimensions by delineation of shadows in a sequence of SAR images of an urban scene. The estimation of building dimensions is automatic; user interaction is limited identifying a building of interest and a region of background clutter close to the building. Results are presented for six different buildings, in each case two SAR images were used in the estimation process separated in illumination angle by either 28deg or 90deg. The estimates of building dimensions are compared with the actual building dimensions obtained from architectural drawings. The algorithm was found to perform robustly and provide reasonably accurate estimates of the building dimensions, typically within ~10% of the true values.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Estimating building dimensions from synthetic aperture radar image sequences"}, "arnumber": "4509479", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4509475/4509479", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T15:52:17", "contentType": "periodicals", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "2098KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876126", "documentLink": "/document/6876126"}, "displayText": "Shanshan Chen, Haipeng Wang, Feng Xu, Ya-Qiu Jin, \"Automatic Recognition of Isolated Buildings on Single-Aspect SAR Image Using Range Detector\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 12, pp. 219-223, 2015, ISSN 1545-598X.", "title": "Automatic Recognition of Isolated Buildings on Single-Aspect SAR Image Using Range Detector", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1933KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6573417", "documentLink": "/document/6573417"}, "displayText": "Xiao Xiang Zhu, Muhammad Shahzad, \"Facade Reconstruction Using Multiview Spaceborne TomoSAR Point Clouds\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 3541-3552, 2014, ISSN 0196-2892.", "title": "Facade Reconstruction Using Multiview Spaceborne TomoSAR Point Clouds", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "729KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5764772", "documentLink": "/document/5764772"}, "displayText": "Fengli Zhang, Yun Shao, Xiao Zhang, Timo Balz, \"Building L-shape footprint extraction from high resolution SAR image\", <em>Urban Remote Sensing Event (JURSE) 2011 Joint</em>, pp. 273-276, 2011.", "title": "Building L-shape footprint extraction from high resolution SAR image", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1913KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008520", "documentLink": "/document/6008520"}, "displayText": "Fabio Dell'Acqua, Christian Bignami, Marco Chini, Gianni Lisini, Diego Aldo Polli, Salvatore Stramondo, \"Earthquake Damages Rapid Mapping by Satellite Remote Sensing Data: L'Aquila April 6th 2009 Event\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 4, pp. 935-943, 2011, ISSN 1939-1404.", "title": "Earthquake Damages Rapid Mapping by Satellite Remote Sensing Data: L'Aquila April 6th, 2009 Event", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "450KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7730911", "documentLink": "/document/7730911"}, "displayText": "Jinxing Chen, Fan Wu, Chao Wang, Wanming Lei, \"Detection of building radar footprints from single VHR SAR images\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2016 IEEE International</em>, pp. 7326-7329, 2016, ISSN 2153-7003.", "title": "Detection of building radar footprints from single VHR SAR images", "order": "5"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1694KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5337973", "documentLink": "/document/5337973"}, "displayText": "Dominik Brunner, Guido Lemoine, Lorenzo Bruzzone, Harm Greidanus, \"Building Height Retrieval From VHR SAR Imagery Based on an Iterative Simulation and Matching Technique\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 48, pp. 1487-1504, 2010, ISSN 0196-2892.", "title": "Building Height Retrieval From VHR SAR Imagery Based on an Iterative Simulation and Matching Technique", "order": "6"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "177KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779677", "documentLink": "/document/4779677"}, "displayText": "Dominik Brunner, Guido Lemoine, Lorenzo Bruzzone, \"Extraction of Building Heights from VHR SAR Imagery using an Iterative Simulation and Match Procedure\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 2008.

Their application in the underwater environment is usually confined to the deployment and synthesis of linear apertures. Incoherent SAS processing is a suboptimal approach compared with coherent SAS processing as the absence of phase information results in an inferior along-track resolution and a higher sidelobe level. The absence of phase information implies that incoherent processing is not constrained by phase-aliasing. Incoherent SAS can accommodate non-uniform inter-ping spacing and is tolerant to trajectory estimation errors of the order of the range-compressed pulse length. This presents new opportunities for a robust surveying system. Apertures of nonlinear shapes can be synthesised depending on the nature and requirement of the specific application and environment. Surveys can be conducted with minimal hardware deployment, such as by a diver. On the basis of this concept, tank trial results of a 3-dimensional incoherent SAS technique utilising the synthesis of 2D apertures are presented. Broadband pulses are employed to achieve optimal survey resolution. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated for both monostatic and single-transmit, multiple-receive configurations.

However, the change in phase chirp rate caused by the complex motion of ships will deteriorate the azimuth focusing quality. In this paper, we first model the complex motion of ship target with cubic phase terms (parameterised on chirp rate and its change rate), then a new ISAR imaging method, referred to as TC-DechirpClean, is proposed, which estimates the chirp rate and the change rate of chirp rate of all scatters in the time-chirp distribution plane.

Such a spatial separation results in problems and special requirements that are either not encountered or encountered in less serious form for monostatic SAR. Directly associated with these requirements one has to solve the problems of highly accurate time and phase synchronisations. The impact of oscillator frequency instability on BiSAR is analysed, and a time and phase synchronisation technique via direct-path signal is proposed. With the proposed technique, the direct-path signal of transmitter is received with one appropriative antenna and divided into two channels, one is passed through an envelope detector and used to synchronise the sampling clock, and the other is down-converted and used to compensate the phase synchronisation errors. Finally, the residual time synchronisation error is compensated with range alignment, and the residual phase synchronisation error is compensated with global positioning system/inertial navigation system/inertial measurement units (GPS/INS/IMU) information; then the focusing of BiSAR image can be achieved. Based on this technique, a prototype linearly frequency modulated BiSAR synchronisation system is constructed.The effectiveness of this proposed technique is verified with simulation data.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Time and phase synchronisation via direct-path signal for bistatic synthetic aperture radar systems"}, "arnumber": "4437846", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4437845/4437846", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:49:08", "contentType": "periodicals", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "1331KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5466526", "documentLink": "/document/5466526"}, "displayText": "Hana Godrich, Alexander M.

Second, the EKF supplements the estimated orientation with a measure of the uncertainty in that estimate. Such estimates of uncertainty are crucial in a number of applications, including using the orientation estimates to approximate the radar cross section of the aircraft under track, in an attempt to identify targets. The EKF's performance is demonstrated using both a straight-and-level manoeuvre and a complicated manoeuvre recorded on-board a manoeuvring F-15.

The parametric Rao and parametric generalised likelihood ratio test detectors, recently developed by modelling the disturbance as a multichannel autoregressive (AR) process, have been shown to perform well with limited or even no range training data. These parametric detectors, however, assume that the model order of the multichannel AR process is known a priori to the detector. In practice, the model order has to be estimated by some model order selection technique. Meanwhile, a standard non-recursive implementation of the parametric detectors is computationally intensive since the unknown parameters have to be estimated for all possible model orders before the best one is identified. To address these issues, herein the joint model order selection, parameter estimation and target detection are considered. We present recursive versions of the aforementioned parametric detectors by integrating the multichannel Levinson algorithm, which is employed for recursive and computationally efficient parameter estimation, with a generalised Akaike Information Criterion for model order selection. Numerical results show that the proposed recursive parametric detectors, assuming no knowledge of the model order, yield a detection performance nearly identical to that of their non-recursive counterparts at significantly reduced complexity.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Recursive parametric tests for multichannel adaptive signal detection"}, "arnumber": "4437853", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-14T11:08:03", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4437845/4437853", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "658KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5494503", "documentLink": "/document/5494503"}, "displayText": "Pu Wang, Hongbin Li, Braham Himed, \"Bayesian parametric approach for multichannel adaptive signal detection\", <em>Radar Conference 2010 IEEE</em>, pp. 838-841, 2010, ISSN 1097-5659.", "title": "Bayesian parametric approach for multichannel adaptive signal detection", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "461KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210195", "documentLink": "/document/5210195"}, "displayText": "Pu Wang, Hongbin Li, Braham Himed, \"A New Parametric GLRT for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 58, pp. 317-325, 2010, ISSN 1053-587X.", "title": "A New Parametric GLRT for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1137KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020816", "documentLink": "/document/6020816"}, "displayText": "Pu Wang, Hongbin Li, Braham Himed, \"Knowledge-Aided Parametric Tests for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 59, pp. 5970-5982, 2011, ISSN 1053-587X.", "title": "Knowledge-Aided Parametric Tests for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "558KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6166358", "documentLink": "/document/6166358"}, "displayText": "Pu Wang, Zafer Sahinoglu, Man-On Pun, Hongbin Li, \"Persymmetric Parametric Adaptive Matched Filter for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection\", <em>Signal Processing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 60, pp. 3322-3328, 2012, ISSN 1053-587X.", "title": "Persymmetric Parametric Adaptive Matched Filter for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection", "order": "4"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "4", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.043524S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Recursive parametric tests for multichannel adaptive signal detection", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Recursive parametric tests for multichannel adaptive signal detection"}}, "Article 7": {"details": {"issue": "1", "volume": "2", "authors": [{"name": "D.J.

The aim of this development is to increase the accuracy of estimates of inertial state vectors in all the network nodes, including the navigation states, and also to improve the fault tolerance of inertial network systems. An analysis of distributed inertial sensing models is presented and new distributed data fusion algorithms are developed for inertial network systems. The distributed data fusion algorithm comprises two steps: inertial measurement fusion and state fusion. The inertial measurement fusion allows each node to assimilate all the inertial measurements from an inertial network system, which can improve the performance of inertial sensor failure detection and isolation algorithms by providing more information. The state fusion further increases the accuracy and enhances the integrity of the local inertial states and navigation state estimates. The simulation results show that the two-step fusion procedure overcomes the disadvantages of traditional inertial sensor alignment procedures.

A technique to correct the MTRC in the case of uniform rotation rate is proposed. An estimation of the rotation vector of the non-cooperative targets is not required. The approach compensates the rotational motion in two steps: the slant-range rotation compensation (SRRC) and the cross-range rotation compensation (CRRC).

The optimisation of a binary integrator is not a simple task, because it requires the solution of a (<i>k</i> x <i>n</i>)-dimensional nonlinear optimisation problem, where <i>n</i> is the number of integrated bits (or the number of sensors in a distributed radar or sensor network) and <i>k</i> is the number of the design parameters of the single-pulse detector. An algorithm that converts the multi-dimensional optimisation problem into a one-dimensional problem, so reducing considerably the computational complexity, is developed. This reduction in computational complexity makes the real-time optimisation possible and practical, so it is very helpful for mobile sites in which the optimisation should be performed continually. The proposed algorithm can be applied when either the 'AND' or the 'OR' integration rule is adopted. The results are illustrated by means of two study cases. In the first case, the binary integrator of a constant false alarm rate radar detector is optimised; in the second one a decentralised detection system composed by <i>n</i> similar sensors is considered and the decision rules are jointly optimised according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Optimisation of binary integrators for decentralised detection"}, "arnumber": "4437851", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T14:36:47", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4437845/4437851", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.020576S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Optimisation of binary integrators for decentralised detection", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Optimisation of binary integrators for decentralised detection"}}, "Article 9": {"details": {"issue": "1", "volume": "2", "authors": [{"name": "R.

It perceives persons behind walls or at great distances and in situations where persons have no or poor visibility. Human motion modulates the radar signal which can be observed in the spectrogram of the received signal. Extraction of these movements enables the animation of a person in virtual reality. The authors focus on a fast feature-based approach to estimate human motion features for real-time applications. The human walking model of Boulic is used, which describe the human motion with three parameters. Personification information is obtained by estimating the individual leg and torso parameters. These motion parameters can be estimated from the temporal maximum, minimum and centre velocity of the human motion distribution. Three methods are presented to extract these velocities. Additionally, we extract an independent human motion repetition frequency estimate based on velocity slices in the spectrogram. Kalman filters smooth the parameters and estimate the global Boulic parameters. These estimated parameters are input to the human model of Boulic which forms the basis for animation. The methods are applied to real radar measurements. The animated person generated with the extracted parameters provides a realistic look-alike of the real motion of the person.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Feature-based human motion parameter estimation with radar"}, "arnumber": "4469865", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4469857/4469865", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T12:05:15", "contentType": "periodicals", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "1600KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6212271", "documentLink": "/document/6212271"}, "displayText": "Svante Bj&#x00F6;rklund, Tommy Johansson, Henrik Petersson, \"Evaluation of a micro-Doppler classification method on mm-wave data\", <em>Radar Conference (RADAR) 2012 IEEE</em>, pp. 0934-0939, 2012, ISSN 1097-5659.", "title": "Evaluation of a micro-Doppler classification method on mm-wave data", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "271KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7411895", "documentLink": "/document/7411895"}, "displayText": "W.

Each underwater-acoustic vector-hydrophone consists of two or three collocated but orthogonally oriented velocity-hydrophones, and a pressure-hydrophone.

The peak of the horizontally polarised Doppler spectra was found to depend on the component of the phase velocity of the breaking waves in the line of sight of the radar. The analysis was presented in terms of two main scattering components, one slow and one fast, which could explain the Doppler spectra as well as the higher moments of the spectra. The connection to the amplitude statistics for the two components was also discussed. The slow component was present all the time and had amplitude statistics that were Rayleigh-distributed. The fast component was present only intermittently and had amplitude statistics that were spikier than the Rayleigh distribution. The width of the spectra varied with azimuth in a way unrelated to the direction relative to the wind.

Since the frequency spectrum of the sweep signal varies against time, a novel algorithm, namely a time-frequency cross-correlation (TFCC) algorithm based on wavelet packet transform (WPT), is proposed to estimate the time delay of sweep signal. In this algorithm, the source sweep and the received signals are decomposed with WPT to obtain their time-frequency representations and the TFCC between the source sweep and the received signals is performed. Each reflected sweep in the received signal is converted into a time-frequency correlation peak whose position can indicate its time delay. The TFCC algorithm can suppress ambient noise effectively and improve the performance of sweep extraction and can match more precisely the source and the reflected sweeps to their known time-frequency characters. Numerical experiments were performed to compare the performance of the TFCC algorithm with that of the conventional cross- correlation and phase-data algorithms. The results proved that the TFCC algorithm can extract the reflected sweeps effectively and its performance is better than that of the conventional algorithms.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Sweep signal time-delay estimation with time-frequency cross-correlation algorithm"}, "arnumber": "4469863", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:08:35", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4469857/4469863", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "155KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6864566", "documentLink": "/document/6864566"}, "displayText": "Fangfang Jiang, Sijia Sun, \"Identity recognition based on power spectral analysis of pulse wave signal\", <em>Medical Imaging Physics and Engineering (ICMIPE) 2013 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 348-351, 2013.", "title": "Identity recognition based on power spectral analysis of pulse wave signal", "order": "1"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.02505S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Sweep signal time-delay estimation with time-frequency cross-correlation algorithm", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Sweep signal time-delay estimation with time-frequency cross-correlation algorithm"}}, "Article 9": {"details": {"issue": "2", "volume": "2", "authors": [{"name": "P.-Y.

The basic theory of digital signal processing in noise radar design is treated. The theory supports the use of noise waveforms for radar detection and imaging in such applications as covert military surveillance and reconnaissance.

A SAR image generated with a noise SAR suffers from the masking effect which is tied to residual random fluctuations in noise radar response from bright scatterers in the scene. This is similar to the masking effect present in the deterministic waveform SAR when the signal sidelobes of echoes from bright scatterers may mask the main response from a weaker target. The procedure presented is a variation of the CLEAN algorithm. Knowing precisely the emitted signal and finding positions of the strongest scatterers one may model the echo signal originated from a selected scatterer. Extraction of the modelled signal from the received one reduces the residual fluctuations and makes it possible to clean the image and increase its dynamic range. The final image is constructed from the cleaned signal and the previously removed strongest scatterers. A theoretical background is provided to the proposed procedure and its application to enhance the SAR image using simulated data as well as data generated by the Ka-band bistatic GB NW-SAR is demonstrated. The GB NW-SAR, recently developed and tested in LNDES IRE NASU, may operate in CW and pulse random signal regimes for short range applications.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Quality enhancement of image generated with bistatic ground based noise waveform SAR"}, "arnumber": "4607170", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T13:31:12", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4607165/4607170", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "3673KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6494419", "documentLink": "/document/6494419"}, "displayText": "Mark A.

In receivers, the locally generated codes (replicas) are correlated with received signals to extract a particular satellite's signal and wipe-off its pseudorandom code. The signals received are generally misaligned with replicas. As a result, receivers search for signals using different codes, code phases, and additional residual sinusoidal demodulations at several possible frequencies. This search is called acquisition and it is computationally challenging for receivers operating under weak signal conditions. Software GPS receivers have been developed over the past several years and continue to be an area of extensive research. Faster, less complex, and more efficient algorithms are required for software GPS receivers. We present a fast algorithm for accelerating acquisition. Several frequency domain approaches proposed by authors earlier are combined to reduce computational complexity. These are (i) joint code, code delay and frequency search; (ii) limited code-phase search; and (iii) a shifting replica approach. Significant gains in arithmetic complexity are achieved. A novel method for restoring correlation degradation introduced by limited code phase search is also presented in this paper. Overall performance of the acquisition is illustrated on different platforms.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Fast acquisition implementation for high sensitivity global positioning systems receivers based on joint and reduced space search"}, "arnumber": "4611490", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:25:27", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4611485/4611490", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "2335KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7073475", "documentLink": "/document/7073475"}, "displayText": "Grant Huang, David Akopian, C.

The proposed algorithm is applied on Doppler radar signal and it represents an alternative approach to Doppler radar signal analysis using the Fourier transform. The algorithm is tested using data obtained in real measurements by ground surveillance Doppler radar. The numerical results are compared with those obtained by the method using the Fourier transform. It is shown that the ground clutter due to windblown vegetation, which is the main challenge for radar to detect moving object, does not affect the information entropy.

These signals can be employed for performing radar measurements with multiple transmitters being simultaneously active, for example, in radar networks or multi-input multi-output radar applications. Since all the signals of the individual transmitters occupy the full available bandwidth, no deterioration of the achievable range resolution occurs. This study comprises both the theoretical considerations as well as the verification simulations and measurements. A particular focus is on the requirements regarding the frequency and time synchronisation of the individual signals and their impact on the achievable performance. The influence of possible Doppler shifts is also considered. Finally, a performance comparison with classical code-based multiple user access techniques is provided. The achieved results demonstrate that the proposed multi-carrier waveforms clearly outperform the classical code-based approach under realistic assumptions of synchronisation accuracy.", "link":

The normal parameters (delays, amplitudes and number of targets, noise variance) of the received signal are assumed to be unknown. In the particular problem under study, range resolution and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are the most important parameters. However, with the use of the conventional matched filter or inverse filter, one parameter is optimised while the other cannot be guaranteed at a desired level and the receiving system is always fixed by the initial design that is unsuitable for every actual condition. The authors proposed a novel delay estimation filter &#x2013; exponential filter (EF), with a sensitivity exponent &#x003B1; that controls its output SNR and range resolution. Based on the proposed EF, delay estimation algorithm that is optimal for actual requirements is proposed for multi-targets problem.

This study proposes a novel acquisition algorithm based on the discrete chirp-Fourier transform (DCFT) to solve the problems above. The 1 ms complex correlation is modelled as a chirp signal to account for high dynamics effect. Then the DCFT is introduced to simultaneously estimate the Doppler shift and Doppler rate residuals. In this way, the 1 ms complex correlations are coherently post-integrated and a high processing gain can be obtained when both the primary and secondary code phases are aligned. Furthermore, the false alarm and detection probabilities are derived to statistically characterise the acquisition performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is tolerant of high dynamics and robust to noise.

In contrast to existing CS SAR methods that employ only a forward SAR transform in pre- or post-processing, the proposed method employs both forward SAR and reverse SAR (R-SAR) transforms in each CS iteration to improve the quality of reconstructed images. This study proposes a simple and elegant truncation repair method to combat the truncation error and utilises non-uniform fast Fourier transform to reduce the SAR and R-SAR transform errors, thereby ensuring the convergence of the CS algorithm and improving the quality of the reconstructed images. The proposed CS SAR method is applied to microwave and millimeter wave imaging systems for non-destructive evaluation of materials embedded in stratified media. Three different specimens under test are measured by conventional uniform sampling and by random under-sampling with 20% or 30% spatial points of the uniform sampling. The reconstructed images show that, albeit having much less measurement points, the proposed CS method achieves better image quality and lower background artefacts than the images reconstructed from the fullysampled uniform measurements.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Compressed sensing for SAR-based wideband three-dimensional microwave imaging system using non-uniform fast fourier transform"}, "arnumber": "6573686", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:35:31", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573679/6573686", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "1100KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7752616", "documentLink": "/document/7752616"}, "displayText": "Dongjie Bi, Yahong Rosa Zheng, \"A new multi-frequency compressed sensing model for 2-D near-field synthetic aperture radar\", <em>Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP) 2016 8th International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-5, 2016, ISSN 2472-7628.", "title": "A new multi-frequency compressed sensing model for 2-D near-field synthetic aperture radar", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1210KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6898933", "documentLink": "/document/6898933"}, "displayText": "Pratik Maheshwari, Victor Khilkevich, David Pommerenke, Hamed Kajbaf, Jin Min, \"Application of emission source microscopy technique to EMI source localization above 5 GHz\", <em>Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) 2014 IEEE International Symposium on</em>, pp. 7-11, 2014, ISSN 2158-1118.", "title": "Application of emission source microscopy technique to EMI source localization above 5 GHz", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2398KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7747447", "documentLink": "/document/7747447"}, "displayText": "Mohammad Tayeb Ghasr, Matthew J.

To achieve optimal performance, an ideal tracking system should maintain contact with the target and constantly update its tracking data. One of the major problems to consider arises from the target motion uncertainty. Although the variance of the overall noise is time-varying and may reduce tracking efficiency, it is difficult to adaptively approximate this uncertainty. To solve these computational problems, a variety of techniques have been studied, and the adaptive interacting multiple model has shown the best result. However, predefined sub-models with different conditions for multiple models are required. Moreover, the acceleration intervals for different acceleration levels should be determined in advance. To alleviate these problems, the authors propose a multiple-structured smart tracking algorithm which properly separates the acceleration from the overall noise by fuzzy c-means clustering. The filter in the algorithm recognises the manoeuvring target as if it does not include the acceleration input, and precisely tracks the target with multiple structures. This study focuses on the acceleration causing the uncertainty and three-dimensional (3D) motion of the real target motion in the tracking problem. Finally, a 3D cruise missile example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Fuzzy c-means clustering-based smart tracking model for three-dimensional manoeuvring target including unknown acceleration input"}, "arnumber": "6573683", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-14T11:36:03", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573679/6573683", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.016889S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Fuzzy c-means clustering-based smart tracking model for three-dimensional manoeuvring target including unknown acceleration input", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Fuzzy c-means clustering-based smart tracking model for three-dimensional manoeuvring target including unknown acceleration input"}}, "Article 10": {"details": {"issue": "6", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Leilei Kou", "affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Maosheng Xiang", "affiliation": "nstitute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Xiaoqing Wang", "affiliation": "nstitute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Minhui Zhu", "affiliation": "nstitute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}], "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2012.0230", "publisher": "IET", "abstract": "Circular synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging on the geosynchronous orbit has significant potential advantages, such as high resolution three-dimensional imaging, large coverage, but it also has challenges to overcome.

In this study, the authors mainly consider the tropospheric effects on L-band GEOCSAR imaging.

methods to determine the time varying position and velocity of a moving object on Earth surface using suitable measurements; it is typically performed in signal-degraded environments where GPS signals

The multi-constellation approach is a possible way to fill this gap. In this work GPS/GLONASS systems are combined and single point algorithm performance is assessed for different configurations in urban scenario. GLONASS is nearly fully operational and its inclusion guarantees satellite availability improvement, but the GPS/GLONASS multi-constellation use involves the addition, as further unknown, of the intersystem time-scale offset. The considered estimation techniques are Least Squares and Kalman filter. The first method uses only the measurement model, with the drawback of solution unavailability during GNSS outages. The last uses, in addition to a measurement model, a process model allowing the estimation of the unknowns in case of GNSS outage. To improve both methods performances aiding are considered on height and intersystem time scale offset. The main purposes of this work are the performance assessment of a multi-constellation system relative to GPS-only, adopting the aforesaid estimators, and the benefit evaluation of the aiding.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Performance assessment of aided Global Navigation Satellite System for land navigation"}, "arnumber": "6573687", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:24:38", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573679/6573687", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "2420KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923271", "documentLink": "/document/6923271"}, "displayText": "Domenico Schiavulli, Ferdinando Nunziata, Maurizio Migliaccio, Giovanni Pugliano, \"A resolution enhancement technique for GNSS-R Delay Doppler Map\", <em>Environmental Energy and Structural Monitoring Systems (EESMS) 2014 IEEE Workshop on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2014.", "title": "A resolution enhancement technique for GNSS-R Delay Doppler Map", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2422KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6934165", "documentLink": "/document/6934165"}, "displayText": "Ciro Gioia, Daniele Borio, \"Asynchronous pseudolites and GNSS hybrid positioning\", <em>Localization and GNSS (ICL-GNSS) 2014 International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-6, 2014, ISSN 2325-0771.", "title": "Asynchronous pseudolites and GNSS hybrid positioning", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "480KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6947312", "documentLink": "/document/6947312"}, "displayText": "Domenico Schiavulli, Ali Ghavidel, Adriano Camps, Maurizio Migliaccio, \"A simulator for GNSS-R polarimetric observations over the ocean\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2014 IEEE International</em>, pp. 3802-3805, 2014.", "title": "A simulator for GNSS-R polarimetric observations over the ocean", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "431KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6577253", "documentLink": "/document/6577253"}, "displayText": "Antonio Angrisano, Salvatore Gaglione, Ciro Gioia, Daniele Borio, Joaquim Fortuny-Guasch, \"Testing the test satellites: the Galileo IOV measurement accuracy\", <em>Localization and GNSS (ICL-GNSS) 2013 International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-6, 2013, ISSN 2325-0771.", "title": "Testing the test satellites: the Galileo IOV measurement accuracy", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "653KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7028060", "documentLink": "/document/7028060"}, "displayText": "Fucheng Dai, Xuchu Mao, \"Dual GNSS systems positioning based on nonlinear filter and satellites selection in bad conditions\", <em>System Integration (SII) 2014 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on</em>, pp. 334-339, 2014.", "title": "Dual GNSS systems positioning based on nonlinear filter and satellites selection in bad conditions", "order": "5"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "5", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.042851S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Performance assessment of aided Global Navigation Satellite System for land navigation", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Performance assessment of aided Global Navigation Satellite System for land navigation"}}, "Article 11": {"details": {"issue": "6", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Bo Jiu", "affiliation": "National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University"}, {"name": "Hongwei Liu", "affiliation": "National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University"}, {"name": "Bo Chen", "affiliation": "National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University"}, {"name": "Zheng Liu", "affiliation": "National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University"}], "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2012.0193", "publisher": "IET", "abstract": "Transmission waveform design based on the target and the surrounding environment plays an important role in wideband target recognition radar, which could be helpful to enlarge the separation between the received echoes of different targets.

To help solve the problems, fractal characteristics of IPIX datasets in fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domain are analysed making use of the fluctuation of FRFT amplitudes and moving target detection algorithms are proposed based on the fractal characteristics in FRFT domain. Firstly, fractal model in FRFT domain is established with fractional Brownian motion model and two judgment and extraction methods are employed for calculating the fractal characteristics in FRFT domain. It is found that sea clutter of different polarisations exhibit fractal behaviours in FRFT domain, that is, self-similarity property, within its corresponding scale-invariant interval. Then, we find that four specific fractal statistics in the best FRFT domain can provide valuable information for developing simple and effective detectors.

Therefore a robust non-homogeneity detection algorithm by utilising the prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF) is proposed to eliminate the outliers from the training samples set in this study, which can estimate the clutter covariance matrix more accurately for STAP. In the proposed method, the basis vectors of PSWF according to the system parameters are first calculated, which can be computed offline and stored in memory beforehand, and then the corresponding clutter covariance matrix is constructed.

Although time/frequency interference suppression methods have been widely studied in the literature, they fail to cope with wideband interference signals. Instead, techniques utilising several antenna elements can be employed to mitigate both narrowband and broadband interference signals. However, the performance of beamforming techniques utilising antenna arrays severely degrades in dealing with correlated and coherent multipath components which cause signal cancellation phenomenon and temporal correlation matrix rank deficiency. This study proposes a two-stage beamformer to jointly deal with interference and multipath signals. In the first stage, before the despreading process, by applying the subspace method, the interference subspace is estimated and used as a constraint for the optimisation problem in the next stage. In the second stage, a modified version of the minimum power distortionless response beamformer employing several overlapping sub-arrays called the minimum difference output power method is utilised to mitigate the correlated multipath components. The proposed beamformer can deal with the signal cancellation phenomenon and temporal correlation matrix rank deficiency. Several simulation examples and a real data test are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer.

The novelty of the proposed method is that it exploits prior knowledge on the environment and combines it with ray-tracing electromagnetic modelling to determine some information about the possible multipath structure. This information is used to separate the environment into different regions based upon the behaviour of the multipath components. Specifically, as a case study, the authors consider a radar and a target in the presence of a perfectly reflecting planar surface. For this environment, three regions are determined based on the amount of overlap among the multipath components. For each region, receivers are designed exploiting the multipath structure. Thus, a different viewpoint to analyse radar detection problems is suggested. The two main results are the improvement in the target probability of detection, by properly accounting for the multipath and a priori determination of the best performing detector based upon the location of the target and the available signal-to-noise ratio.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Improved detection probability of a radar target in the presence of multipath with prior knowledge of the environment"}, "arnumber": "6475225", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:32:17", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6475219/6475225", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "302KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7415022", "documentLink": "/document/7415022"}, "displayText": "A.

These coefficients are broadcast to the users on the basis of seasonal ionospheric variations and average solar flux. In low-latitude Indian region, prediction of the delay using these coefficient is not accurate because of complex behaviour of the ionospheric. In this study, new Klobuchar-like cofficients are generated using regional total electron content data collected from the 18 stations in Indian. Using these coefficients, a novel approach for near-real-time prediction of the ionospheric delay (for every 5 min) is proposed. This approach provides the opportunity to generate the Klobuchar-like coefficients using shorter data sets (1 day) rather than using long-term statistics of several years, as done in the generation of GPS broadcast Klobuchar coefficients. Performance of the prediction is evaluated for the geomagnetic quiet (A<sub>p</sub> index &lt;;50) and severely disturbed (A<sub>p</sub> index &gt;300) days of 2005 and 2007.

The probability hypothesis density (PHD) and cardinalised PHD (CPHD) algorithms based on the particle filter have proved to be promising algorithms for multi-target tracking. However, they have a heavy computational burden because of the particle clustering in the stage of state extraction. Especially, the additional calculation is added to the CPHD algorithm because of the estimation of the cardinality distribution. To solve the problem, the authors propose a novel multiple manoeuvring target tracking algorithm by extending the multi-model method to the cardinality-balanced multi-target multi- Bernoulli filter and then using the sequential Monte Carlo implementation. Moreover, in order to obtain the individual target tracks, the particle labelling technique is introduced in the proposed algorithm.

Since wind turbines have moving components that generate return signals with non-zero Doppler velocity, traditional ground clutter filters are ineffective at removing wind turbine clutter (WTC). In this study, a WTC mitigation algorithm using the range-Doppler spectrum is developed and tested with simulated weather and WTC signals. Once the general locations of the WTC contamination are known, the proposed range-Doppler regression (RDR) algorithm exploits the spatial continuity of weather signals in the range domain to mitigate the WTC contamination while retaining as much weather signal as possible. In contrast to other proposed mitigation algorithms, the RDR algorithm is suited for real-time implementation on typical operational weather radars. Simulated data are used to optimise the parameters of the algorithm and evaluate its performance for stratiform- and convective-precipitation cases with different degrees of WTC contamination. Finally, a real data case is processed to illustrate the RDR algorithm's effectiveness.

The variation in total electron content (TEC), originating from ionospheric turbulence, causes the along track point spread function (PSF) to degrade in a manner which depends on ionospheric conditions. In this study, the effect of this PSF on the single point statistics (probability density function) and two point statistics (autocorrelation function (ACF)) is derived. It is shown that the <i>K</i>-distribution order parameter is directly proportional to the ionospheric turbulence, as quantified by <i>C</i><sub>k</sub><i>L</i>. The complex ACF is a measure of amplitude scintillation, and the intensity ACF is a measure of both the order parameter and the terrain correlation length.

Ultrasonic images refer to the representation of the environment with the help of ultrasonic waves and based on sonar principle. The generation of ultrasonic images is based on the classical methodology of the sonar, having target detection and classification purposes as main applications. An element of the image (which could be assimilated as pixel) has the intensity proportional to signals reflected by the surface of objects in the explored environment. Sonar heads with biomimetic functional behaviour (i.e. having one emitter and two receivers) were built. The key motivation in deploying such sonar heads is efficiency, that is, simplicity combined with acceptable performances based on ultrasonic image processing. Simplicity is related to modularity and portable structure, in the sense of computer's portability. Biomimetism has a double meaning, by the structure of the sonar head and by the nature of the exploring algorithms (which use observations on bat behaviour). This work considers airborne ultrasonic images at distances less than one metre and with fixed working frequency (40 kHz). The preliminary results show the feasibility of the approach and consolidate a research direction focused on navigation based on airborne ultrasonic image processing.", "link":

So far, this spectrum has only been used within range-Doppler algorithm to process BSAR data. The authors investigate the possibility and results of applying this modified version of LBF as a basis for omega-K algorithm. Two approaches, based on Stolt interpolation and inverse scaled Fourier transform, are examined and their effectiveness in general azimuth-variant geometry is validated through several simulations. The proposed implementations show higher performance in terms of image quality measurements as compared to extended LBF-based implementations.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Using omega-&#x003BA; algorithm for bistatic synthetic aperture radar image formation based on modified extended Loffeld's bistatic formula"}, "arnumber": "6573720", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:59:04", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573720", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.01719S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Using omega-&#x003BA; algorithm for bistatic synthetic aperture radar image formation based on modified extended Loffeld's bistatic formula", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Using omega-&#x003BA; algorithm for bistatic synthetic aperture radar image formation based on modified extended Loffeld's bistatic formula"}}, "Article 9": {"details": {"issue": "4", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Imanol de Arriba-Ruiz", "affiliation": "Technical University of Madrid, E.T.S.I.

This 'all-weather' system is able to provide slant-range - Doppler images of non-cooperative targets whose motion is unknown. Conventional ISAR systems are designed for imaging targets with a direct line of sight of sensors. For this reason, they have a reduced performance in today's complex scenarios - such as urban environments - where secondary returned waveforms are added to directly reflected echoes coming from targets. They are known as ghost artefacts since they obscure true targets when using the standard range-Doppler algorithm (RDA). In this study, an innovative multipath mitigation technique is presented, in which 'time reversal (TR)' concept is implemented in ISAR images, leading to 'TRISAR algorithm'. For this purpose, a pre-processing algorithm is previously needed so as to solve the geometric problem related to multipath. Finally, superresolution algorithms provide us with the tools to mitigate the spurious component that arises during the averaging process carried out by TR-ISAR. The authors' conclusion is that imaging quality after employing superresolution approaches is clearly improved. As a proof-of-concept, real data from high-resolution radar have been used to verify the proposed method.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Multipath mitigation techniques based on time reversal concept and superresolution algorithms for inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging"}, "arnumber": "6573723", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:25", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6573714/6573723", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "121KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7003424", "documentLink": "/document/7003424"}, "displayText": "Takuya Sakamoto, Toru Sato, \"Exploiting multipath echoes with Capon method for high-resolution ultra-wideband radar imaging using a single omni-directional antenna\", <em>Antenna Measurements & Applications (CAMA) 2014 IEEE Conference on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2014.", "title": "Exploiting multipath echoes with Capon method for high-resolution ultra-wideband radar imaging using a single omni-directional antenna", "order": "1"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.024972S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Multipath mitigation techniques based on time reversal concept and superresolution algorithms for inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Multipath mitigation techniques based on time reversal concept and superresolution algorithms for inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging"}}}, "Issue 8": {"Article 8": {"details": {"issue": "8", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Xinhui Wu", "affiliation": "College of Electronic Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan 430033, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Gao Ming Huang", "affiliation": "College of Electronic Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan 430033, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Jun Gao", "affiliation": "College of Electronic Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan 430033, People's Republic of China"}], "keywords": [{"kwd": ["tracking filters", "probability", "target tracking"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["adaptive noise variance identification", "estimation accuracy", "time-varying noise variance", "variational Bayesian approximation", "extended PHD filter", "inverse-Gamma component", "Gaussian component", "posterior intensity decomposition", "received measurements", "scan time", "probability hypothesis density-based multitarget filter"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2012.0291", "publisher": "IET", "abstract": "A new extended probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is proposed for joint estimation of the time-varying number of targets and their states without the measurement noise variance.

Also included are two examples demonstrating that the KF is not the universally asserted minimum variance linear unbiased estimator.

In auxiliary beam TSI suppression, the TSI in the main radar beam is estimated by a single or several auxiliary beams and is subtracted from the main beam channel. The signal to subtract is the auxiliary beam signals fed through an estimate of the `reflection system', which describes scattering on the surface. The authors first present results on the structure of this TSI suppression, on the estimation of the reflection system and on the quality of the estimate. Then the authors derive theoretical expressions for the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and the remaining TSI power for a single auxiliary beam. Since the SINR is directly connected to the radar performance, it can be seen what factors affect the performance and how. It was noted that when the estimated reflection system is missing one or more delays of the true system, the TSI filter cannot suppress the TSI signal completely. This phenomenon, which is called `TSI leakage', has a very large impact on the performance. The SINR cannot be kept constant.

For the signals, how to avoid possible energy cancellation of odd and even chips and how to quickly test code phases as many as possible in parallel are two keys for rapid acquisition. In this study, an interleaving of local code replicas-based acquisition method is proposed. By interleaving odd-number and even-number chips of local code replicas, the proposed method breaks the intrinsic code phase relation of PN-codes, avoids the possible energy cancellation of odd and even chips, and accelerates the search process by testing more code phases through interleaved chips. The detection and mean acquisition time performance of the proposed method is analysed. It is shown that compared with the previous time-gate method, the proposed method greatly saves computation requirement by taking the advantage of frequency-domain correlation technique over time-domain one.

In the proposed method, dual channel SAR data are sampled sparsely in the azimuth direction and jointly processed. Firstly, a transform matrix is constructed to separate the energy support areas of moving targets from that of all scattering centres.

Extended targets (as opposed to point target) have various scattering centres, such as the familiar point, localised and distributed scattering centres, as well as the rarely discussed but often encountered migratory scattering centres. The migratory scattering phenomenon of smooth surface is particularly concerned in this study. The motion information recoded in radar signals are actually that of migratory scattering centres rather than the real motions of the rigid target. Therefore the misleading motion information will bring unpredictable error to the radar application of target discrimination or recognition. To tackle this problem, the influence of migratory scattering phenomena of extended targets on micro-motion characteristics contained in radar signal is analysed in detail.

The coning error, which is one of dominant error sources affecting the accuracy of attitude computation in the inertial navigation system (INS), is induced by the sinusoidal motion such as a manoeuvre of vehicle or the vibration of a dithering of ring laser gyro. However, many researchers have developed coning error mitigation algorithms based on the higher-order polynomial model and its correction terms are extracted from the gyro output without faithful consideration of the periodicity of motion. Hence, the authors first detect and estimate the sinusoidal components from gyro measurements, and then find the higherorder correction terms from the estimated sinusoidal parameters. The authors also show that this algorithm can be applied to the mitigation of sculling error because of its duality to the coning motion. Simulation results show that the direct compensation algorithm works effectively for the navigation of vehicles with continuous and steady oscillations.

However, since practical target scatterers do not lie exactly in the frequency lattice of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) basis, there is always mismatch between the assumed DFT basis and the actual dictionary for sparsity. To address this, the authors consider the radar echo sparsifying dictionary as refinable and develop a compressive imaging approach using dynamic dictionaries. The approach treats the frequency gridding points as adjustable parameters of the sparsifying Fourier dictionary and achieves dynamical dictionary refinement via iterative optimisation of these parameters. To achieve joint image formation and dictionary refinement, the approach utilises the variational expectation-maximisation algorithm to iteratively perform a two-step process, that is, estimating sparse backscattering coefficients given a dictionary and then updating the dictionary to better fit the data sparsity model. The experimental results based on both synthetic and anechoic chamber data demonstrate that the approach improves the precision in range estimation and suppresses spurious spikes in the constructed profiles.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Compressive high-range-resolution radar imaging using dynamic dictionaries"}, "arnumber": "6574783", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T14:16:36", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6574779/6574783", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.019302S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Compressive high-range-resolution radar imaging using dynamic dictionaries", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Compressive high-range-resolution radar imaging using dynamic dictionaries"}}, "Article 10": {"details": {"issue": "5", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Peilin Sun", "affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Jun Tang", "affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Qian He", "affiliation": "Electronic Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu 611731, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Ba Tang", "affiliation": "504 Laboratory, Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei 230037, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Xiaowei Tang", "affiliation": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China"}], "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2012.0139", "publisher": "IET", "abstract": "In this study, a general signal-processing architecture is proposed for next generation radar (NGR).

Finally, the effectiveness of this method is validated by the simulation results.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Single snapshot imaging method in multiple-input multiple-output radar with sparse antenna array"}, "arnumber": "6574787", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:41", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6574779/6574787", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.017033S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Single snapshot imaging method in multiple-input multiple-output radar with sparse antenna array", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Single snapshot imaging method in multiple-input multiple-output radar with sparse antenna array"}}, "Article 11": {"details": {"issue": "5", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Liu Gaogao", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Electronic Information Countermeasure and Simulation Technology Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Peng Li", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Electronic Information Countermeasure and Simulation Technology Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Shiyang Tang", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Electronic Information Countermeasure and Simulation Technology Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Linrang Zhang", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Electronic Information Countermeasure and Simulation Technology Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China"}], "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2012.0134", "publisher": "IET", "abstract": "The motion compensation (MOCO) plays a significant role to accommodate the motion errors caused by atmosphere turbulence and/or aircraft maneuvers in airborne synthetic aperture radar configurations. In broadside or small squint cases, the well-focused image can be obtained by the typical two-step MOCO to have the quadratic motion errors compensated. However, with the increasing of squint angle, not only the high-order motion errors, but also the azimuth-variant errors must be taken into account. In this study, a modified non-linear chirp scaling (MNLCS) algorithm is proposed to handle this problem in highlysquinted case. The key is to use the method of series reversion to cover the high-order motion errors, the MNLCS to precondition the data to process the azimuth-variant components and a series expansion to obtain an accurate form of the signal spectrum. The skewed spectrum in highly-squinted case is reduced through the use of a linear range cell migration correction. The simulated results have shown the MNLCS algorithm can handle data with more complicated geometries than the previous algorithm.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Focusing highly squinted data with motion errors based on modified non-linear chirp scaling"}, "arnumber": "6574790", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:30:48", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6574779/6574790", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.020504S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Focusing highly squinted data with motion errors based on modified non-linear chirp scaling", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Focusing highly squinted data with motion errors based on modified non-linear chirp scaling"}}, "Article 5": {"details": {"issue": "5", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Branko Ristic", "affiliation": "ISR Division, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, 506 Lorimer Street, Melbourne, VIC 3207, Australia"}, {"name": "Alfonso Farina", "affiliation": "SELEX ES, Via Tiburtina km 12,400, 00131 Rome, Italy"}], "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2011.0395", "publisher": "IET", "abstract": "This article studies the problem of joint detection and tracking of a target using multi-static Doppler-only measurements.

The ideas are compared, and among the various strategies discussed, a particle filter that operates directly on the monopulse measurements seems to be the best.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "MCMC methods for tracking two closely spaced targets using monopulse radar channel signals"}, "arnumber": "4225367", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T13:53:09", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4225360/4225367", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.021831S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "MCMC methods for tracking two closely spaced targets using monopulse radar channel signals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "MCMC methods for tracking two closely spaced targets using monopulse radar channel signals"}}, "Article 10": {"details": {"authors": [{"name": "N.

As is well known, the magnitude of the frequency response of the matched filter is identical to the magnitude of the spectrum of the transmitted waveform. The logic is to amplify those frequencies where the signal's power spectral density is high and attenuate frequencies dominated by noise. A recently published paper [M. Shinriki et al., 2006] suggests a new pulse compression approach that is the antithesis of the matched filter. Rather than utilising the power in the spectral mainlobe of the transmitted waveform, the suggested mismatched filter attenuates the frequencies occupied by the waveform's spectral mainlobe and enhances the sidelobe frequencies. In this way, the suggested approach squeezes a 1 ms delay resolution out of an unmodulated 5 ms pulse.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "COMMENT - COMMENT ON 'MULTI-RANGERESOLUTION RADAR USING SIDEBAND SPECTRUM ENERGY'"}, "arnumber": "4225370", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T13:50:14", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4225360/4225370", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.016928S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "COMMENT - COMMENT ON 'MULTI-RANGERESOLUTION RADAR USING SIDEBAND SPECTRUM ENERGY'", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "COMMENT - COMMENT ON 'MULTI-RANGERESOLUTION RADAR USING SIDEBAND SPECTRUM ENERGY'"}}, "Article 3": {"details": {"authors": [{"name": "W.

The conventional approach to image rejection in RF receivers is to employ a front-end RF tuner before downconversion to the intermediate frequency. As DOA processing employs a separate receiver channel for each array element, an RF tuner would be needed behind each element. Clearly for scanned systems at microwave frequencies, this is not a viable option where the tuners would generally have to be implemented in RF hardware. The need for RF tuners can be eliminated by downconversion down to baseband and employing I&amp;Q mixers, which provide an intrinsic image rejection capability. Unfortunately, such a solution requires two analog-to-digital (A/D) converters per array element. An alternative approach is to use image rejection mixers in which case only one A/D converter per array element is needed. The approach also requires only one A/D per array element but achieves the image rejection through a DSP implementation. As a result, use of relatively expensive image rejection mixers is avoided without sacrificing performance. Experimental results are presented that validate the theoretical predictions.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Image frequency suppression in frequency-scanned direction-of-arrival estimation systems"}, "arnumber": "4225363", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:17:14", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4225360/4225363", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018299S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Image frequency suppression in frequency-scanned direction-of-arrival estimation systems", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Image frequency suppression in frequency-scanned direction-of-arrival estimation systems"}}, "Article 11": {"details": {"authors": [{"name": "M.

As a consequence, the signals passing through the lower branch of the GSC are decomposed into more appropriate subband components by such filter banks according to the input data statistics to enhance the interference suppression capability. The determination of the filter bank coefficients, however, calls for computationally demanding nonlinear optimisation. To alleviate the computational overhead, an iterative procedure is also proposed, which solves the Rayleigh quotient in each iteration. Furthermore, a detailed performance analysis of the proposed beamformer is conducted, which includes the development expression of the output signal to interference-plus-noise ratio and its implications, and the analysis of the convergence characteristic.

SAR GMTI requires that relative speed between the target and the SAR platform is included in the detection algorithm. A separation between the true relative speed and the relative speed used in the SAR process will cause unfocused targets, and decrease detectability. Blind hypotheses of relative speeds are used in the detection phase of moving targets in SAR. The step size between the hypotheses (or discretisation step) in relative speed involves a trade off between the number of hypotheses to test and detectability. A large number of tests will increase detectability but will also increase computation load and vice versa. The relevance of relative speed increases as the azimuth integration time gets larger. Long integration time is associated with low signature moving target detection in strong clutter environments, or for SAR GMTI at low frequencies. The optimum discretisation of normalised relative speed for moving target detection has been determined. The optimum discretisation is derived from the moving target impulse response.

The rationale behind this requirement is that this additional capability greatly enhances the utility of military and commercial systems. Two approaches to improving the dynamic range of modern radar and surveillance receivers are described: (1) linearisation of intermodulation distortion (IMD) using digital post-distortion algorithms and (2) linearisation of IMD using frequency retranslation mixer (FRM). The experimental results presented illustrate that the digital post-distortion and FRM approaches are effective in providing IMD improvements for the hardware and test scenarios measured. The improvements measured ranged from 15 to 35 dB for narrowband signals to 2-6 dB for frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) wideband signals. The digital post-distortion approach provided the greatest performance improvement when the input signals were between the analogue-to-digital converter full range and 20 dB below that level. The improvements measured for the FRM linearisation approach ranged from 20 to 25 dB for the narrowband two-tone tests and 16-18 dB for the wideband FMCW signal chirps.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Dynamic range improvements and measurements in radar systems"}, "arnumber": "4405565", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:28:27", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4405563/4405565", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "2389KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5605172", "documentLink": "/document/5605172"}, "displayText": "Volkan Turgul, Meltem Dirim, Sukru B.

Scheduling is an important sub-problem of radar resource management because of the strong correlation between how tasks should be performed, as well as the time available to carry them out and their timeliness. Two scheduling algorithms previously reported in the literature are compared in order to investigate differences in their performance. This provides new insights which may be invaluable in the development of future optimal schedulers. A detailed model of a multifunction radar has been developed to enable comparison using the same operational conditions. The radar is assumed to operate in both 'underload' and 'overload' situations. When not fully loaded (i.e. underload), the two scheduling algorithms perform in significantly different ways. However, in the more important case of overload situations, where there are insufficient radar resources to carry out all necessary tasks, both algorithms provide similar performance.

Given some of the strategic advantages for a bistatic configuration, and technological advances in the past few years, large-scale implementation of the bistatic systems is a scope for the near future. If the bistatic systems are to replace the monostatic systems (at least partially), then all the existing usages of a monostatic system should be manageable in a bistatic system. A detailed investigation of the possibilities of an automatic target recognition (ATR) facility in a bistatic radar system is presented. Because of the lack of data, experiments were carried out on simulated data. Still, the results are positive and make a positive case for the introduction of the bistatic configuration. First, it was found that, contrary to the popular expectation that the bistatic ATR performance might be substantially worse than the monostatic ATR performance, the bistatic ATR performed fairly well (though not better than the monostatic ATR). Second, the ATR performance does not deteriorate substantially with increasing bistatic angle. Last, the polarimetric data from bistatic scattering were found to have distinct information, contrary to expert opinions. Along with these results, suggestions were also made about how to stabilise the bistatic-ATR performance with changing bistatic angle. Finally, a new fast and robust ATR algorithm (developed in the present work) has been presented.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Bistatic SAR ATR"}, "arnumber": "4405572", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T13:01:23", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4405563/4405572", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "4408KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5595603", "documentLink": "/document/5595603"}, "displayText": "Amit Kumar Mishra, Mulgrew Bernard, \"Automatic Target Recognition using Multipolar Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar Images\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 46, pp. 1906-1920, 2010, ISSN 0018-9251.", "title": "Automatic Target Recognition using Multipolar Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar Images", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1595KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131093", "documentLink": "/document/7131093"}, "displayText": "Ellen E.

Usually, since the initial phase of a complex HRRP is strongly sensitive to target position variation, only the amplitude information in complex HRRPs is used for RATR, whereas the phase information is discarded. However, the remaining phase information except for initial phases in complex HRRPs may also contain valuable target discriminant information. RATR using complex HRRPs is discussed. The complex HRRPs' feature subspace within each target-aspect sector is extracted via principal component analysis as the corresponding template during the training phase; while in the test phase we decide that a test sample belongs to the feature subspace which has the test sample's minimum reconstruction error approximation. It is shown that the whole process is independent of the initial phases, but exploits the remaining phase information in complex HRRPs. Furthermore, to make the proposed recognition method more practical, a fast time-shift compensation algorithm is proposed. In the recognition experiments based on measured data, the proposed recognition method using complex HRRPs achieves better recognition results than that using only the amplitude vectors of the complex

The system is based on a supervised approach that uses augmented reality (AR) images for training computer added detection and classification (CAD/CAC) algorithms, which are then deployed on real data. The algorithms are able to generalise and detect real targets when trained on AR ones, with performances comparable with the state-of-the-art in CAD/CAC. To illustrate the approach, the focus is on one specific algorithm, which uses Bayesian decision and the novel, purpose-designed central filter feature extractors. Depending on how the training database is partitioned, the algorithm can be used either for detection or classification. Performance figures for these two modes of operation are presented, both for synthetic and real targets. Typical results show a detection rate of more that 95% and a false alarm rate of less than 5%. The proposed supervised approach can be directly applied to train and evaluate other learning algorithms and data representations.

For this latter relevant case, a new CFAR algorithm is porposed based on goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests. The performance of the proposed detector is numerically investigated through Monte Carlo simulations assuming heavy-tailed Weibull and Lognormal distributed clutter. Numerical results shown that, in heavy-tailed clutter and also when several interfering targets exist, the proposed detector outperforms the conventional CFAR detector based on binary integration.

Thus, it will be possible to detect cars and measure their speed from the acquired along track interferometric data. The development of vehicle-detection algorithms requires the knowledge of the radar signatures of vehicles, especially under consideration of the geometry of the radar look direction and the vehicle orientation. The radar signatures of the non-moving cars are presented. They are estimated experimentally from airborne E-SAR multi-frequency and polarimetric data, which have been collected during a flight campaign in 2003. Radar signatures are estimated for a considerable part of aspect angles ranging from 0deg to 180deg. The large synthetic aperture length of the E-SAR radar sensor allows the look processing of data and therefore allows an increase of the aspect angle resolution. The radar signature analysis for one type of passenger cars showed that the largest radar cross-section values and thus the greatest chance for high probability of detection are for cars standing in rear and front views of radar beam direction. This holds true for all frequencies and co-polarisations. Radar cross-section values for cross-polarisations and diagonal views are much lower and are therefore less suitable for car detection. The radar signature profile over a considerable range of aspect angles in fine resolution can be used further for the verification of simulation studies and for the performance prediction for traffic monitoring with a coming German TerraSAR-X satellite", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Measurement of radar signatures of passenger cars: airborne SAR multi-frequency and polarimetric experiment"}, "arnumber": "4197522", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T13:43:28", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4197511/4197522", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "2240KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7065350", "documentLink": "/document/7065350"}, "displayText": "N.T.

Field experimental data recorded by the HFSWR OSMAR2003 (Ocean State Monitor and Analysis Radar, manufactured in 2003) has been used in detailed investigations of the directional characteristics for this ionosphere clutter, leading to the development of effective mitigation techniques based on antenna design and adaptive signal processing. Particular attention is given to the amplitude and phase relationship among multiple spatial channels for two types of ionospheric clutter. Preliminary experimental results show that the random gain and phase variation of the antenna pattern overhead null destroyed the amplitude and phase consistency among channels. As a result, no significant measured directivity is observed in this type of specular clutter.

This paper uses information theory to place bounds on the performance of ATR algorithms which use features based on an object's shadow as a classification cue. Information is used to compute different bounds on the performance of any classification method. The technique is applied to a simple classification task namely to discriminate between circular and square shapes. The effect of sensor characteristics, such as contrast and resolution, are computed. An example is given where the bounds on performance for a sidescan sonar with given characteristics under some environmental conditions are computed. The performance is then analysed as a function of the shapes being classified by changing the circular shape to a superellipse.

In this paper, we construct a new family of TF distributions, namely, the joint distributions, to estimate the IF curves in order to reduce outliers in the cases of low SNRs. The construction of the joint distributions is based on the definition of the directionally smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distributions (DSPWVD) and pointwise adaptive weight averaging of a bank of DSPWVDs with different directions. The segments of the IF curve whose directions are close to that of the DSPWVD can be highlighted by each DSPWVD and the entire IF curve will be enhanced by the joint TF distribution.

Previous works have been shown that the interference pattern suffers from temporal and spatial variations in uncertain environment. This could cause the performance degradation of the processor. Theoretical analyses are presented for water-depth mismatch and sound-speed profile (SSP) mismatch. The theoretical results are then demonstrated by examples using both simulations and ocean acoustic data. The results suggest that the water-depth mismatch just shifts the peak around the correct one and the sound-speed mismatch can be neglected for the very low frequency even without constant water sound speed. But its robustness to SSP mismatch does not exist for higher frequency. For sediment-type mismatch, although a large modelled mistake is introduced, the results are acceptable. This implies that the effect of sediment-type mismatch is minor compared to that of mismatches in water column.

However, their major drawback is the isolation required between transmitter and receiver that typically leads to the use of two separate antennas for transmission and reception. Some schemes have been proposed to enable FMCW radars to operate with a single antenna. Frequency modulated interrupted continuous wave (FMICW) is a possible solution. However, some considerations must be taken into account before implementing this technique in high resolution radars because of the amount of bandwidth needed. The problems associated with the use of the FMICW technique in broadband radars are analysed and a staggering procedure is proposed to overcome them. This technique is tested using simulated data from a 1 GHz bandwidth millimetre wave sensor, currently under development. The results are compared against other single antenna configurations and the advantages of the staggering technique are shown.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Stagger procedure to extend the frequency modulated interrupted continuous wave technique to high resolution radars"}, "arnumber": "4267622", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:15:14", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4267617/4267622", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "1001KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895309", "documentLink": "/document/4895309"}, "displayText": "Pablo Almorox-Gonzalez, Jos\u00c9-Tom\u00c1s Gonzalez-Partida, Mateo Burgos-Garcia, B.

Using full-scale target signature measurements as the source data, it is shown how, for the first time, multiple perspectives enhance the classification performance. Indeed this is the case even if only one additional perspective is available for exploitation. Further, we explore the classification performance both as a function of the number of perspectives and of the signal to noise ratio. Three approaches to high range resolution profile multi-perspective classification have been implemented. This removes any possible bias that could be introduced by a single individual classifier. The results show, for all three, a consistent improvement in the classification performance, as the number of perspectives is increased. The techniques employed also provide considerable insight into the classification process highlighting the degree of complexity of this extremely challenging problem.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Radar target classification using multiple perspectives"}, "arnumber": "4267624", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T15:41:40", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4267617/4267624", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "1554KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008645", "documentLink": "/document/6008645"}, "displayText": "Graeme E.

Some EW receivers receive radar pulses, measure the parameter of each pulse received and group the pulses that belongs to the same emitter together to determine the radar parameters for each emitter. These parameters are then compared with values stored for known radar types, to identify the emitter type. Two parts are focused, emitters deinterleaving and PRF-type identification. The deinterleaving is done through parameters clustering. Two parameters are selected for clustering direction of arrival and radio frequency. A self-organising neural network called Fuzzy ART is proposed for clustering. This algorithm has a very good clustering quality and can run in real-time applications.The PRF-type identification is done through time-of-arrival (TOA) analysis. Three previously presented algorithms are combined in new scheme to do the TOA analysis (or PRF-type identification). These algorithms are difference TOA histogram, TOA folding histogram and sequence search algorithm. The complete proposed system has been tested using three different tests.

Each weight may depend inversely on the measurement error in the parameter with which the weight is associated.

The majority of these applications utilise both the global positioning system (GPS) and the inertial navigation system (INS). These AI modules were trained to mimic the latest vehicle dynamics so that, in case of GPS outages, the system relies on INS and the recently updated AI module to provide the vehicle position. Several neural networks and neuro-fuzzy techniques were implemented in real-time in a de-centralised fashion and provided acceptable accuracy for short GPS outages. It was reported that these methods provided poor positioning accuracy during relatively long GPS outages. In order to prevail over this limitation, this study optimises the Al-based INS/GPS integration schemes utilising adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system with performing, in real-time, both GPS position and velocity updates. In addition, a holdout cross validation method during the update procedure was utilised in order to ensure generalisation of the model. The proposed system is tested using differential GPS and both navigational and tactical grades INS field test data obtained from a land vehicle experiment. The results showed that the effectiveness of the proposed system over both the existing Al-based and the conventional INS/GPS integration techniques, especially during long GPS outages.

The system is based on a commercial-off-the-shelf and open architecture approach, using a direct digital synthesiser, a field programmable gate array and a digital signal processor as core components. Instrument function testing, calibration and the results of the initial field tests are reported. Some of the first multistatic experimental results are reported and demonstrate a number of aspects of the performance of such a configuration. The advantages and limitations of a low-cost digital radar design are discussed and further system development possibilities outlined. This system will enable the collection of a wide range of novel multistatic data and has the potential to demonstrate a number of new radar applications.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Design and evaluation of a low-cost multistatic netted radar system"}, "arnumber": "4299459", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4299454/4299459", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T14:27:10", "contentType": "periodicals", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "611KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020778", "documentLink": "/document/6020778"}, "displayText": "Kevin Chetty, Graeme E.

Analytic expressions are developed for tracking performance in terms of the probability of correct association and estimation accuracy.

The authors combine the spread spectrum technology with the classic pulse harmonic radar system to overcome the dilemma between accuracy and detection range.

To cope with this necessity, a new decision category entitled `unidentified' is introduced based on the variance of the difference in peak-to-peak intervals. Firstly, the successive received signal strength is modelled for a given scan pattern, and then the effects of the position and movement of an ES receiver onto the identification accuracy are examined to analyse the tendency of false identifications. Simulations are included to confirm the effect of the proposed new feature parameter.

BOC modulated signals are, however, characterised by ambiguous multi-peaked correlation functions and several techniques have been proposed in the literature to solve the problem of locking into secondary peaks. In this study, a novel unambiguous BOC tracking technique, the double phase estimator (DPE), is designed to account for the effect of signal bandlimiting. The DPE is an effective alternative to the double estimator (DE) tracking technique where the subcarrier lock loop is replaced by a subcarrier phase lock loop.

Hence, the inertial navigation system is usually used to aid the acquisition and tracking. Compared with the traditional scale tracking, the vector tracking has better performances in the navigation robustness and the immunity to interferences. Although the vector tracking aided by a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) is not as good as the one aided by high-grade IMU in the tracking performance and stability, the low-cost IMU based vector tracking loop has lower price, smaller size and lighter weight. Hence, it is valuable to reduce the expense of ultra-tight integration system. In this paper, an ultra-tight integration system using the low-cost IMU based vector tracking is proposed to achieve the vector tracking and navigation for high dynamic applications. As the critical factor in the ultra-tight integration, the Doppler frequency shift is estimated and compensated to achieve the acquisition and tracking of every satellite. Then, a vector tracking Kalman filter is designed to implement the vector tracking and integrated navigation. To verify the effectiveness of the ultra-tight integration, an experiment system is built and a high dynamic scenario is simulated. The results prove that the designed ultra-tight integration system has perfect tracking and navigation performances for high dynamic applications.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Performance assessment of a low-cost inertial measurement unit based ultra-tight global navigation satellite system/inertial navigation system integration for high dynamic applications"}, "arnumber": "6867024", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T13:54:31", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6867010/6867024", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "5202KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7467403", "documentLink": "/document/7467403"}, "displayText": "Hai Yang, Wei Li, Chengming Luo, Jinyao Zhang, Zhuoyin Si, \"Research on Error Compensation Property of Strapdown Inertial Navigation System Using Dynamic Model of Shearer\", <em>Access IEEE</em>, vol. 4, pp. 2045-2055, 2016, ISSN 2169-3536.", "title": "Research on Error Compensation Property of Strapdown Inertial Navigation System Using Dynamic Model of Shearer", "order": "1"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.022953S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Performance assessment of a low-cost inertial measurement unit based ultra-tight global navigation satellite system/inertial navigation system integration for high dynamic applications", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Performance assessment of a low-cost inertial measurement unit based ultra-tight global navigation satellite system/inertial navigation system integration for high dynamic applications"}}, "Article 10": {"details": {"issue": "7", "volume": "8", "authors": [{"name": "Bruno Demissie", "affiliation": "Dept. for Sensor Data &amp; Inf.

Hence, it is necessary to decontaminate the echo signals before the coherent integration process. In this study, the pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution is proposed as a means of estimating the ionospheric frequency modulation. A frequency weighting method is used to obtain the instantaneous frequency (IF) from the time-frequency distribution and an adaptive low-pass filter is introduced to purify the IF. Then, the amplitude difference between the two first-order Bragg peaks is adopted in the weighting process to obtain the phase compensation function.

Then an interesting phenomenon is found in the FR domain, that is, the mixer output is concentrated in a low FR region, while the Gaussian noise spreads over the entire FR region. Therefore, a range-spread target detector has been proposed that regards the integration of the values in a vicinity of zero FR as the test statistic.

Also, it has been found that the use of CP data can be further extended into many other polarimetric applications, and the three-component decomposition can achieve a better result with CTLR mode than with <i>&#x03C0;</i>/4 mode.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Analysis of three-component decomposition to compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar"}, "arnumber": "6846233", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T13:57:08", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6846219/6846233", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "692KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306149", "documentLink": "/document/7306149"}, "displayText": "Hanning Wang, Zhimin Zhou, Raja Syamsul Azmir Raja Abudullah, Qian Song, Khairul Khaizi Mohd Shariff, \"Three-component decomposition based on stokes vector for compact polarimetric SAR under &#x03C0;/4 mode\", <em>Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR) 2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on</em>, pp. 38-42, 2015.", "title": "Three-component decomposition based on stokes vector for compact polarimetric SAR under &#x03C0;/4 mode", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "991KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131152", "documentLink": "/document/7131152"}, "displayText": "Hanning Wang, Zhimin Zhou, John Turnbull, Qian Song, \"Explicit expressions of Freeman-Durden decomposition for compact polarimetric SAR under CTLR mode\", <em>Radar Conference (RadarCon) 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 1067-1071, 2015.", "title": "Explicit expressions of Freeman-Durden decomposition for compact polarimetric SAR under CTLR mode", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "461KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7346240", "documentLink": "/document/7346240"}, "displayText": "Hanning Wang, Zhimin Zhou, John Turnbull, Qian Song, Qi Feng, \"Three-component decomposition based on stokes vector for compact polarimetric SAR under the CTLR mode\", <em>Radar Conference (EuRAD) 2015 European</em>, pp. 73-76, 2015.", "title": "Three-component decomposition based on stokes vector for compact polarimetric SAR under the CTLR mode", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "5538KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7327184", "documentLink": "/document/7327184"}, "displayText": "G.

The moments are then used to determine the SAR radiometric calibration error and image contrast from the one-way <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> index. It is also shown that monostatic SAR experiences an <i>S</i><sub>4</sub>-dependent radar cross-section (RCS) enhancement that is not experienced by bistatic SAR.

The description of anisotropic effects is reviewed and extended to cover SAR. The variation over the Earth is illustrated, showing that a sun-synchronous satellite will experience the strongest effect near Brazil.

Considerations must be given to both the computational complexity and the focus depth of the false scatterers of a deception template. However, existing methods cannot meet both demands mentioned above when generating jamming signal of an extended false scene or scattered false targets. In this study, a frequency-domain three-stage algorithm (FDTSA) is proposed. In theory, the jammer system is deliberately reformatted in the two-dimensional frequency domain. Accordingly, the implementation of the FDTSA can be effectively accelerated by fast Fourier transform and by separating the modulation process of a repeat jammer into three stages: the offline stage, the initialisation stage and the real-time modulation stage. Theoretical analyses and simulation results indicate that the FDTSA can get rid of severe focus deterioration of the false scatterers and reasonable computational load is required.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "A frequency-domain three-stage algorithm for active deception jamming against synthetic aperture radar"}, "arnumber": "6846228", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-11-03T14:01:57", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6846219/6846228", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "2873KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7457599", "documentLink": "/document/7457599"}, "displayText": "Yongcai Liu, Wei Wang, Xiaoyi Pan, Qixiang Fu, Guoyu Wang, \"Inverse Omega-K Algorithm for the Electromagnetic Deception of Synthetic Aperture Radar\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 9, pp. 3037-3049, 2016, ISSN 1939-1404.", "title": "Inverse Omega-K Algorithm for the Electromagnetic Deception of Synthetic Aperture Radar", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1634KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7152833", "documentLink": "/document/7152833"}, "displayText": "Letao Xu, Dejun Feng, Xiaoyi Pan, Qingfu Liu, Xuesong Wang, \"An Improved Digital False-Target Image Synthesizer Method for Countering Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar\", <em>Sensors Journal IEEE</em>, vol. 15, pp. 5870-5877, 2015, ISSN 1530-437X.", "title": "An Improved Digital False-Target Image Synthesizer Method for Countering Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1388KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7152832", "documentLink": "/document/7152832"}, "displayText": "Letao Xu, Dejun Feng, Yongcai Liu, Xiaoyi Pan, Xuesong Wang, \"A Three-Stage Active Cancellation Method Against Synthetic Aperture Radar\", <em>Sensors Journal IEEE</em>, vol. 15, pp. 6173-6178, 2015, ISSN 1530-437X.", "title": "A Three-Stage Active Cancellation Method Against Synthetic Aperture Radar", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2540KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7471407", "documentLink": "/document/7471407"}, "displayText": "Yongcai Liu, Wei Wang, Xiaoyi Pan, Letao Xu, Guoyu Wang, \"Influence of Estimate Error of Radar Kinematic Parameter on Deceptive Jamming Against SAR\", <em>Sensors Journal IEEE</em>, vol. 16, pp. 5904-5911, 2016, ISSN 1530-437X.", "title": "Influence of Estimate Error of Radar Kinematic Parameter on Deceptive Jamming Against SAR", "order": "4"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "4", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.040016S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "A frequency-domain three-stage algorithm for active deception jamming against synthetic aperture radar", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "A frequency-domain three-stage algorithm for active deception jamming against synthetic aperture radar"}}}, "Issue 1": {"Article 1": {"details": {"issue": "1", "volume": "8", "authors": [{"name": " Yong Yang", "affiliation": "State Key Lab. of Complex Electromagn.

To know the reason and the mechanism of these differences is very important for GNSS system building and monitoring, especially for the control segment, one major function of which is monitoring the whole system states and ensuring the system reliability. To explain the differences among these observations, a theoretical analysis about the satellite orbit influence on multipath fading is made in this study. The analysis is based on a proposed factor named orbit multipath fading factor, which can reflect the orbit influence independent from the uncontrolled environment factors.

The filtering of the non-linear systems with cross-correlated process and observation noises at the same epoch is studied. First, a decorrelated scheme is introduced and a pseudo non-linear process equation is reconstructed in which the corresponding pseudo process noise is no longer cross-correlated with the observation noise; so a celebrated non-linear filter, that is, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) can be used to filter the non-linear problem. Second, the (conditionally) linear substructure in the above non-linear system is exploited and a refined filter called marginal UKF is employed so as to reduce computational load without deteriorating the accuracy. The performance of the standard UKF for the original system equations, the standard and marginal unscented UKFs for the reconstructed system equation are compared in the simulation. From the results of the simulation, the theoretical statements are validated, and some interesting but not surprising phenomena are also founded, that is, the performance of the conventional filter actually does not degenerate, whereas that of the proposed filters become better when cross-correlation exists and increases. This phenomenon can be due to the fact that the proposed filters exploited the extra information buried in the cross-correlation, whereas the conventional filter fails to do so.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Marginal unscented kalman filter for cross-correlated process and observation noise at the same epoch"}, "arnumber": "6702410", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:12:33", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6702403/6702410", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "682KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237736", "documentLink": "/document/7237736"}, "displayText": "Han Yu, Xiujie Zhang, Shenmin Song, Shuo Wang, \"An improved Gaussian filter with Asynchronously correlated noises\", <em>Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA) 2015 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1670-1675, 2015.", "title": "An improved Gaussian filter with Asynchronously correlated noises", "order": "1"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026291S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Marginal unscented kalman filter for cross-correlated process and observation noise at the same epoch", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Marginal unscented kalman filter for cross-correlated process and observation noise at the same epoch"}}, "Article 3": {"details": {"issue": "1", "volume": "8", "authors": [{"name": "Fabiola Colone", "affiliation": "Dept. of Inf.

To compensate for range migration in high SNRs, two-dimensional median filtering and constant false alarm rate technology are combined to estimate the speed. For low SNRs, based on coarse valuations, the authors use the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) to realise the fractional delay cell to improve speed accuracy. Furthermore, to compensate for Doppler frequency migration, an instantaneous cross-correlation method is proposed for high SNRs, which is combined with the fractional Fourier transform method to estimate the acceleration for low SNRs.

Therefore many algorithms have been proposed to realise channel balancing in multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-ground moving target indication (GMTI) systems, such as an adaptive two-dimensional calibration algorithm, linear fitting algorithm and eigen-decomposition algorithm. However, all of these aforementioned algorithms have some small defects in certain conditions, when used in the real data of multichannel wide area surveillance (WAS)-GMTI systems. The small defects can increase the false alarm probability, which is undesirable in moving target detection. In this study, after the detailed analysis about the interference phase in the wide-area surveillance mode, a novel channel balancing algorithm is proposed to perform channel balancing in multichannel WAS-GMTI systems. The new algorithm mainly concentrates on the balancing of systematic azimuthal phase errors. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated when compared with other typical channel balancing algorithms in Monte Carlo simulations and real data processing.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Channel balancing algorithm in multichannel wide-area surveillance systems"}, "arnumber": "6702407", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T15:58:23", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6702403/6702407", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "2599KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7484303", "documentLink": "/document/7484303"}, "displayText": "Sheng Zhang, Fang Zhou, Guang-Cai Sun, Xiang-Gen Xia, Meng-Dao Xing, Zheng Bao, \"A New SAR&#x2013;GMTI High-Accuracy Focusing and Relocation Method Using Instantaneous Interferometry\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 54, pp. 5564-5577, 2016, ISSN 0196-2892.", "title": "A New SAR&#x2013;GMTI High-Accuracy Focusing and Relocation Method Using Instantaneous Interferometry", "order": "1"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026991S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Channel balancing algorithm in multichannel wide-area surveillance systems", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Channel balancing algorithm in multichannel wide-area surveillance systems"}}, "Article 6": {"details": {"issue": "1", "volume": "8", "authors": [{"name": " Weijian Liu", "affiliation": "Coll. of Electron.

Since PR does not use an own transmitter, it can be installed and operated at low cost and it is hard to detect and jam. These advantages and the increasing maturity of PR technology has led to growing interest in these systems over the last years. However, until now most PR systems have been rather experimental set-ups tailored to a single frequency band or implemented as laboratory test devices. This study in contrast describes the design, implementation and performance evaluation of a multi-band, multi-illuminator PR system developed at near-production stage. Starting out from a FM-broadcast-based approach, the step to DAB-based and DVB-T-based operation has already been made. As a result, a fully mobile FM/DAB/DVB-T multi-band PR system is now available, offering maximum flexibility for measurement campaigns with air, ground and sea targets. Experiments with a great variety of third-party transmitters and arbitrary transmitter-target-receiver geometries have been conducted. The design considerations and the resulting PR system concept are described, and the results of representative measurement campaigns with different types of ground and aerial targets are presented.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Design and performance evaluation of a mature FM/DAB/DVB-T multi-illuminator passive radar system"}, "arnumber": "6746878", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T13:00:18", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6746872/6746878", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "219KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7131100", "documentLink": "/document/7131100"}, "displayText": "Jun Liu, Hongbin Li, Braham Himed, \"Analysis of cross-correlation detector for passive radar applications\", <em>Radar Conference (RadarCon) 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 0772-0776, 2015.", "title": "Analysis of cross-correlation detector for passive radar applications", "order": "1"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.02149S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Design and performance evaluation of a mature FM/DAB/DVB-T multi-illuminator passive radar system", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Design and performance evaluation of a mature FM/DAB/DVB-T multi-illuminator passive radar system"}}, "Article 4": {"details": {"issue": "2", "volume": "8", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel W.

It is well known that the most straightforward way to achieve the target position estimation in the horizontal plane with a passive radar exploits the measurements either of a single bistatic range plus a direction of arrival (DoA) or of two bistatic ranges collected by two separate receivers. However, for a practical application it is interesting to clearly define which one of the two approaches provides the passive radar target localisation with a higher accuracy and whether combining both multiple bistatic range plus DoA measurements provides a further advantage. A multistatic configuration is considered which allows to collect a set of range/Doppler/angle measurements for a given target. Different target localisation strategies are devised and compared, based on subsets of the available measurements with the aim of understanding the localisation accuracies achievable using the different combinations of measurements. Experimental results are shown based on a passive radar prototype developed and fielded at the DIET Department - Sapienza University of Rome.

Compared with global and regional ionospheric models, not much significant work is reported on local ionospheric models for Indian region. In this study, using Indian Satellite Based Augmentation System data, a local ionospheric model based on Taylor series expansion (TSE) is used. Initially, a network of 17 GAGAN total electron content stations data are considered in the analysis for both quiet and disturbed days. The ionospheric time delay results of the TSE model indicate that the model is performing better for quiet days than the disturbed days. The delay because of the TSE model is compared with that of the delays because of Klobuchar and IRI-2007 models and experimental GAGAN data.

Experimental results on the simulated and actual Ku-band SAR data proved that, for full swath and high squint mode FMCW SAR, the proposed approaches are valid and greatly helpful to improve the imaging quality.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Study on the improvements for the high-resolution frequency modulated continuous wave synthetic aperture radar imaging"}, "arnumber": "6985815", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:45", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985815", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "784KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7495113", "documentLink": "/document/7495113"}, "displayText": "Wenge Chang, Haishan Tian, Xiangyang Li, \"Miniature high resolution FMCW SAR system\", <em>Modern Circuits and Systems Technologies (MOCAST) 2016 5th International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2016.", "title": "Miniature high resolution FMCW SAR system", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2428KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7495130", "documentLink": "/document/7495130"}, "displayText": "Chengfei Gu, Wenge Chang, \"An efficient geometric distortion correction method for SAR video formation\", <em>Modern Circuits and Systems Technologies (MOCAST) 2016 5th International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-4, 2016.", "title": "An efficient geometric distortion correction method for SAR video formation", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1179KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7734379", "documentLink": "/document/7734379"}, "displayText": "Chengfei Gu, Wenge Chang, Xiangyang Li, Xinqun Luan, \"The formation of high-resolution FMCW SAR video\", <em>Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)</em>, pp. 496-499, 2016.", "title": "The formation of high-resolution FMCW SAR video", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1059KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7462206", "documentLink": "/document/7462206"}, "displayText": "Gaowei Jia, Wenge Chang, Qilei Zhang, Xinqun Luan, \"The Analysis and Realization of Motion Compensation for Circular Synthetic Aperture Radar Data\", <em>Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 9, pp. 3060-3071, 2016, ISSN 1939-1404.", "title": "The Analysis and Realization of Motion Compensation for Circular Synthetic Aperture Radar Data", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "760KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729284", "documentLink": "/document/7729284"}, "displayText": "Wenge Chang, Haishan Tian, Chengfei Gu, \"FMCW SAR: From design to realization\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2016 IEEE International</em>, pp. 1122-1125, 2016, ISSN 2153-7003.", "title": "FMCW SAR: From design to realization", "order": "5"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "335KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7411909", "documentLink": "/document/7411909"}, "displayText": "Xiangyang Li, Gaowei Jia, Wenge Chang, Chengfei Gu, \"The generalized imaging processing for squinted FMCW SAR\", <em>Radar Conference 2015 IEEE</em>, pp. 364-368, 2015.", "title": "The generalized imaging processing for squinted FMCW SAR", "order": "6"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2321KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7393440", "documentLink": "/document/7393440"}, "displayText": "Dong Li, Huan Lin, Hongqing Liu, Haowei Wu, Xiaoheng Tan, \"Focus Improvement for Squint FMCW-SAR Data Using Modified Inverse Chirp-Z Transform Based on Spatial-Variant Linear Range Cell Migration Correction and Series Inversion\", <em>Sensors Journal IEEE</em>, vol. 16, pp. 2564-2574, 2016, ISSN 1530-437X.", "title": "Focus Improvement for Squint FMCW-SAR Data Using Modified Inverse Chirp-Z Transform Based on Spatial-Variant Linear Range Cell Migration Correction and Series Inversion", "order": "7"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "7", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.063417S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Study on the improvements for the high-resolution frequency modulated continuous wave synthetic aperture radar imaging", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Study on the improvements for the high-resolution frequency modulated continuous wave synthetic aperture radar imaging"}}, "Article 32": {"details": {"issue": "9", "volume": "8", "authors": [{"name": "Sean R.

However, a channel error will affect the clutter suppression performance of the bistatic multi-channel moving target indication radar. And it is found that the channel calibration algorithm used in the long sequence monostatic side-looking synthetic aperture radar, is not applicable to the long sequence translational variant bistatic radar. An improved subspace-based channel calibration algorithm is proposed in this study to deal with channel errors of the GEO SA bistatic multi-channel radar. The algorithm utilises the clutter as calibrated sources, and estimates channel error parameters by minimising the projections of the calibrated sources onto the noise subspace. As the channel errors are estimated from the data, the proposed algorithm does not need any extra calibration sources. Also, the proposed algorithm does not have the limitation of the traditional array self-calibration algorithms, which may have non-unique estimations under the condition of linear arrays. Besides, it avoids finding the inversion of large-size matrix and calculating with any iteration, and hence it is efficient. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can estimate channel errors that vary with azimuth.

Both of them may challenge the conventional motion compensation and imaging methods, which are usually based on the assumption of small rotational angle with short coherent time duration. Moreover, for a multi-functional ISAR, full aperture (FA) data collection might be unachievable because of the conflict with other radar activities, resulting in sparse aperture (SA) data. In this study, an ISAR imaging method of manoeuvring targets with SA data is proposed, where MTRC compensation and time-varying Doppler are well accounted. By using a sparse chirp-Fourier basis with first-order range-azimuth coupling term, an improved orthogonal match pursuit algorithm is implemented to solve the sparsity-driven optimisation for FA data reconstruction from SA-ISAR measurements.

It can solve the misclassification problems caused by the inherent scattering characteristics of polarimetric SAR (PolSAR). Compared with PolSAR, PolInSAR is much more sensitive to the position and distribution of orientated scatterers. In this study, the polarimetric interferometric similarity parameter (PISP) is proposed to display this sensitivity. It is defined by three optimised scattering mechanisms obtained from PolInSAR datasets. Therefore, it closely relates to the coherent scattering mechanism, and makes use of the phase and amplitude's information. Combined with the scattering power SPAN, the PISP is used to divide the pixels into initial regions. Then, the optimal coherence set parameters <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> are used to distinguish target types in each region based on the number of independent coherent scattering mechanisms. At last, the clusters are merged based on scattering characteristics. The proposed method not only employs optimum coherence but also uses the information of optimum scattering mechanisms.

Since TomoSAR has essentially be seen as a spectral estimation problem in the context of array signal processing, most of the methods investigated until now rely on a relatively large tomographic aperture and a relatively high number of receiving antennas in order to be able to separately reconstruct scatterers below the Rayleigh resolution limit. In contrast to that, this study proposes a maximum-likelihood-based approach for tomographic SAR inversion, which provides a better height resolution than conventional array signal processing approaches even if the number of antennas or the overall baseline size is limited. The algorithm is tested on real multi-baseline SAR data acquired over an urban area by an airborne single-pass four-antenna system operating in the millimetre-wave domain.

absence of training data. Such techniques have received comparatively little attention to date in the context of radar systems, and this is mainly because the signal needed for matched filtering (coherent processing) is known a priori. In practice, active and passive radar systems are required to operate in a congested spectrum where an effective interference mitigation capability is critical to successful operation. This study considers the application of the generalised estimation of multipath signals (GEMS) algorithm for BSS to estimate interference waveforms present in the same frequency channel as the signal of interest (SOI). Interference components at the receiving node(s) of the system are reconstructed using these estimates, with site-dependent complex-scales, time-delays and Doppler-shifts to account for multipath effects, and then subtracted from the data in the time domain. A practical demonstration of the proposed method is illustrated using real data from an experimental high frequency radar system that receives a mixture of frequency-modulated and amplitude-modulated continuous waveforms.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Blind source separation with the generalised estimation of multipath signals algorithm"}, "arnumber": "6985852", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2016-10-22T09:05:41", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6985776/6985852", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018886S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Blind source separation with the generalised estimation of multipath signals algorithm", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Blind source separation with the generalised estimation of multipath signals algorithm"}}, "Article 14": {"details": {"issue": "9", "volume": "8", "authors": [{"name": "Li Fu", "affiliation": "Beihang University, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Lingling Wang", "affiliation": "Beihang University, People's Republic of China"}, {"name": "Jianghai Hu", "affiliation": "Purdue University, USA"}, {"name": "Xiaohong Liu", "affiliation": "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunication, People's Republic of China"}], "keywords": [{"kwd": ["telecommunication network reliability", "Doppler effect", "estimation theory", "Global Positioning System", "inertial navigation", "Kalman filters", "nonlinear filters", "phase locked loops", "stability"], "type": "INSPEC: Controlled Indexing"}, {"kwd": ["low carrier-to-noise ratio scenario", "inertial navigation system-aided phase-lock-loop", "integral quadratic constraint approach", "robust navigation", "INS", "Doppler estimator", "extend Kalman fllter", "absolute stability condition", "Global Positioning System carrier tracking loop", "reliability", "third-order carrier tracking loop", "high dynamic flight trajectory"], "type": "INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing"}], "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2013.0361", "publisher": "IET", "abstract": "To satisfy the increasingly challenging specifications in terms of accuracy and availability of the positioning and velocity solution, especially in scenarios where reliable and robust navigation is needed, a novel inertial navigation system (INS) aiding Doppler estimator based on the extend Kalman filter was present.

It is known that, the choice of subarray layout has a strong impact on the performance of subarray level signal processing algorithms. However, the design of subarray partitioning is a difficult problem both in theory and practice. It is extremely valuable to do some research on subarray partition for the huge array radar, especially for those airborne and spaceborne radars with restrict constraint on the cost and space. For these radars, the clutter suppression is an important metric. In this study, the clutter suppressing method by STAP at subarray level is analysed, and the corresponding design of subarray partition is studied. At first, applying the graph theory, a subarray partition strategy is abstracted into a path inside a directed acyclic graph structure. Then, a method based on the ant colony optimisation method is proposed to optimise subarray partition for clutter suppression in STAP. By properly designing the initial and heuristic information, the new method is relatively robust and the complexity is fairly low.

Based on this, they can estimate the spacecraft velocity according to the variation of TOAs instead of the pulse profile distortion. In the proposed estimation method, the total observation interval is divided into several equal observation sub-intervals.

The channels are often mismatched because of various kinds of errors. However, perfectly calibrated channels are always needed to perform an effective GMTI. In this study, the authors present a two-stage channel calibration technique to compensate the channel errors. The authors find that the channel errors can be classified into two categories, that is, the so called convolutional and multiplicative errors. The convolutional errors are more suitable to be compensated in two-dimensional (2-D) frequency domain, whereas the multiplicative errors should be compensated in image domain.

Global positioning system (GPS) is a very useful and cost-effective tool to determine PWV continuously in all weather conditions.

In this study, a novel bistatic fast factorised backprojection (BFFBP) algorithm is presented, which can deal with these two effects accurately and achieve the computational performance in parity with frequency-domain algorithms. First, the imaging geometry with arbitrary motion in elliptical polar coordinate is provided, and the analytical expression of the bistatic backprojection algorithm in this coordinate system is derived, which provides a theory basis for the proposed algorithm. Then, based on the subaperture imaging geometry, the sampling requirements considering motion errors is deduced, which offers the optimal tradeoff between the imaging quality and computational speed. The advantage of using elliptical polar coordinate system for implementing the BFFBP algorithm is analysed. Finally, the implementation and computational burden of the BFFBP algorithm are discussed.

Within each iterative step, the image spectra samples are classified as containing contributions from fundamental, first-order and higher harmonic waves or noise. Based on the classification result, a new scheme is proposed to increase the robustness of current estimation. This involves automatically adjusting the first threshold that is used for obtaining an initial guess of the current velocity in the iterative LS method. The proposed wave algorithm directly uses the classified fundamental and first-order harmonic wave components for wave spectra and parameter retrieval. Unlike previous wave analysis techniques in which a bandpass filter is required to eliminate the non-wave contributions after the current velocity is obtained, the proposed algorithm simplifies the wave retrieval without such a bandpass filter. Algorithm verification is first conducted by using simulated radar images. Subsequently, the method is applied to field radar data and the results are compared with wave-buoy measurements. Wave parameters from both types of data show that the modified wave algorithm produces results that are close to those achieved using traditional algorithms.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Iterative least-squares-based wave measurement using X-band nautical radar"}, "arnumber": "6911064", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-16T09:54:52", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6911062/6911064", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "798KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7003223", "documentLink": "/document/7003223"}, "displayText": "Eric W.

Tracking moving targets in nonlinear systems is one of the most fundamental tasks in this regard and information-type consensus filters (ICFs) have been applied to this problem. To improve the estimate performance, a squared-root cubature information filter which can avoid numerically sensitive matrix operations such as matrix square-rooting and inversion has been developed firstly. And then, based on this filter, a decentralised information filtering algorithm is proposed in an improved consensus framework. Specifically, consensus update at each time-cycle in the modified consensus scheme is computed in two steps, first towards the predicted value and then towards the final information estimate update, which can improve average estimation accuracy and speed the average consensus. Besides the basic merits of the traditional ICFs, the resulting algorithm is more scalable and robust.

The proposed scheme aim to reduce buffer resource required without reducing the number of code, frequency and satellite bins. Therefore the GNSS signal has no information loss. The code acquisition process in a GNSS attempts to find the code phase of a satellite signal, and it includes three procedures: coherent integration (CI), correlation and in CI. The proposed code acquisition architecture provides a lower operation count for correlation with reduced memory consumption. Firstly, the memory in CI and the shift register in the correlator are integrated by changing the operation sequence of CI and correlation. Thus, half of the memory in CI can be removed, and the shift register becomes the sharing buffer for both correlation and CI. Secondly, the addition count in the correlation is reduced by combining a parallel differential matched filter (PDMF) with a two-dimensional (2D) architecture to form a memory-based 2D-PDMF correlator. Finally, changing the sample sequence before integration reduces the memory of in CI.

However, the UMPI test does not apply unless the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is known. However, it provides us with performance bound to evaluate any invariant test's performance when the SNR is unknown.

Most research involving human activity recognition employs the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) as a method of analysing human micro-Doppler signatures. However, the STFT has time-frequency resolution limitations and Fourier transform-based methods are not well-suited for use with non-stationary and non-linear signals. The authors approach uses the empirical mode decomposition to produce a unique feature vector from the human micro-Doppler signals following which a support vector machine is used to classify human motions. This study presents simulations of simple human motions, which are subsequently validated using experimental data obtained from both an S-band radar and a W-band millimetre wave (mm-wave) radar.

On one hand, the OTHR signal is usually contaminated by transient interferences, which usually leads to a significant signal loss in its excision with conventional methods. On the other hand, the sparse OTHR signal will introduce serious grating-lobes in conventional Doppler analysis methods and thus degrade the performance of target detection. In this study, an integrate clutter and target spectrum reconstruction method for sparse OTHR signal are proposed. The proposed method contains two aspects. First, based on the sparse basis representation, a transient interference excision method is developed, which uses time-frequency modulated rectangle window basis to represent the OTHR signal in a sparse way to identify transient interferences. The second aspect lies in that, based on the compressive sensing, a spectrum reconstruction method is proposed to obtain the integrate clutter and target spectrum with sparse samples. By solving the Doppler sparsity constrained optimisation with greedy algorithms, the complete Doppler spectrum is recovered effectively for target detection.

To date, all corresponding tracking methods depend on the precondition that the ionospheric heights should be available via the ionosondes. However, the ionosondes cannot be arbitrary deployed, for example, in sea area or hostile zone. This study presents the problem of sensor fusion of OTHR and a set of forward-based receivers (FBRs) for online mode identification of OTHR echoes, estimation of virtual ionospheric heights and localisation improvement. This fusion problem faces two challenges. The first is 'multi-path', as a kind of uncertainty existing in both the forward propagation of FBRs and the forward/backward propagation of OTHR. The other is 'coupling', representing the complexity that the mode/parameter identification and estimation couple each other. Here the joint optimisation scheme of identification and estimation is proposed mainly including four sub-processes: coordinate mapping with target height, joint identification and estimation of FBRs, mode identification of OTHR and localisation improvement. The simulation shows that propagation/clutter modes can be identified effectively and ionospheric heights are estimated without the help of ionosondes. Meanwhile, target state including the target height is estimated and the localisation accuracy is further improved due to sensor fusion.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Joint mode identification and localisation improvement of over-the-horizon radar with forward-based receivers"}, "arnumber": "6824670", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-08-26T14:55:48", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/6824661/6824670", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.018814S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Joint mode identification and localisation improvement of over-the-horizon radar with forward-based receivers", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Joint mode identification and localisation improvement of over-the-horizon radar with forward-based receivers"}}}}, "metrics": {"Eigenfactor": "0.0034", "Article Influence Score": "0.474", "Imfact Factor": "1.135"}, "2009": {"Issue 3": {"Article 1": {"details": {"issue": "3", "volume": "3", "authors": [{"name": "A.

Utilising this characteristic, the authors present a dual update-rate PLL for modernised GNSS signals to deal with the well-known dilemma that the usage of long coherent integral time can help in reducing the noise from thermal effects, whereas the usage of short coherent integral time can permit the tracking loop to suffer more dynamics stress. By processing data and pilot channels with different coherent integral times, different discriminators, and then performing the fusion of those two different update-rate measurements in a Kalman-filter-based loop filter, this loop offers several advantages over the traditional methods in dynamic and low carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) environments.

However, for a low-frequency SAS system operated in shallow water environments, there are often strong sea surface and bottom reflected multipath components that interfere with the desired echo signals. Based upon a small vertically displaced hydrophone array, several spatial processing algorithms have been proposed for multipath reduction. Most of these algorithms, however, are only applicable to narrowband signals, whereas wideband signals are usually used in low-to-medium-frequency SAS systems in order to achieve a high range resolution. This paper presents a steered robust Capon beamforming (SRCB) approach, and applies the approach, together with the data-independent delay-and-sum beamforming and the conventional wideband robust Capon beamforming, to wideband multipath rejection for shallow water SAS imaging. Numerical simulations of the proposed SAS processing have verified the performance improvements on output image quality over conventional processing in terms of both ghost target strength reduction and contrast enhancement.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Wideband multipath rejection for shallow water synthetic aperture sonar imaging"}, "arnumber": "5332155", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:46:59", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5332148/5332155", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "990KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663800", "documentLink": "/document/5663800"}, "displayText": "Wen Xu, Qing Chen, Jianlong Li, Feng Sun, Xiang Pan, \"Results of a three-row synthetic aperture sonar for multipath rejection\", <em>OCEANS 2010</em>, pp. 1-4, 2010.", "title": "Results of a three-row synthetic aperture sonar for multipath rejection", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2164KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6401207", "documentLink": "/document/6401207"}, "displayText": "Ann Elisabeth Albright Blomberg, Andreas Austeng, Roy Edgar Hansen, Stig Asle Vaksvik Synnes, \"Improving Sonar Performance in Shallow Water Using Adaptive Beamforming\", <em>Oceanic Engineering IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 38, pp. 297-307, 2013, ISSN 0364-9059.", "title": "Improving Sonar Performance in Shallow Water Using Adaptive Beamforming", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2104KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6237595", "documentLink": "/document/6237595"}, "displayText": "Chaoran Du, J.

In the suggested method, for each candidate target at each designated reference aspect, feature matrices called `MUSIC spectrum matrices (MSMs)` are constructed using the target`s scattered data at different late-time intervals. An individual MSM corresponds to a map of a target`s natural resonance-related power distribution over the complex frequency plane under the chosen aspect angle`late-time interval conditions. The collection of these feature matrices is used first to determine the best late-time interval for optimal feature extraction. Then, the MSM of a target, which are computed over the optimal time interval at all reference aspects, are superposed to obtain the `fused MUSIC spectrum matrix (FMSM)`. The FMSM of a target is its main classifier feature in the proposed method as the aspect dependency of an FMSM is highly reduced because of its multi-aspect construction process. The suggested method is demonstrated for both simple and complex target geometries such as conducting spheres, dielectric spheres and small-scale aircraft targets with high accuracy rates even for low SNR values using feature fusion at only a few different reference aspects.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Radar target classification method with reduced aspect dependency and improved noise performance using multiple signal classification algorithm"}, "arnumber": "5332151", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:33:38", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5332148/5332151", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "616KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7060326", "documentLink": "/document/7060326"}, "displayText": "Mahmoud Khodjet-Kesba, Khalil El Khamlichi Drissi, Sukhan Lee, Claire Faure, Christophe Pasquier, Kamal Kerroum, \"Robust UWB radar target classification in white Gaussian noise based on Matrix Pencil Method in Frequency Domain and Mahalanobis Distance\", <em>Radar Conference (Radar) 2014 International</em>, pp. 1-5, 2014.", "title": "Robust UWB radar target classification in white Gaussian noise based on Matrix Pencil Method in Frequency Domain and Mahalanobis Distance", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "276KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6869295", "documentLink": "/document/6869295"}, "displayText": "Salih Poyraz, Mustafa Secmen, \"Location independent radar target classification method with strategy specific late-time intervals\", <em>Radar Symposium (IRS) 2014 15th International</em>, pp. 1-6, 2014.", "title": "Location independent radar target classification method with strategy specific late-time intervals", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "374KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7346362", "documentLink": "/document/7346362"}, "displayText": "M.

Although computationally simple the Crameacuteracute-Rao bound is not useful at low SNR as it does not predict the threshold effect. A more accurate notion of the achievable performance at low SNRs is provided by the computationally more complicated Barankin bound. The computational complexity of the Barankin bound arises from the need to optimise over a number of test points, with the tightness of bound increasing with the number of test points.

The high values of total electron content (TEC), the large diurnal and seasonal variability and intense irregularities present in the low-latitude ionosphere, lead to unacceptable positional errors in GAGAN service region.

In this study, the CCI cancellation algorithm by time and range adaptive processing is proposed for a novel HFSWR - bistatic HF surface wave synthesis impulse and aperture radar. With the real data, the interference is firstly modelled and then its features are investigated. The analyses show that the same interference prevails over a few but different bins through different channels, whereas the echoes are relatively weak and exist in all bins; in range domain, however, the interference takes over all the bins including positive and negative bins and will spread over the same and considerable Doppler area through different channels, whereas the echoes appear only in partially positive bins. On the basis of the features, the interference covariance matrix can be obtained by selecting the samples whose average power is much higher than that of the others in time domain and in range domain; the samples from either or both of beyond the detectable bins and negative bins can be selected for training. The interference can be cancelled by projecting the polluted data into the orthogonal subspace, constructing the projecting matrix with the eigenvectors associated with large eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Finally, the segment handling and samples requirement are also discussed for reducing the computation burden.

Complex motion of targets induce cross-range scatterer-variant quadratic phase terms, which will degrade the cross-range resolution and affect focusing quality. A new algorithm is proposed for the ISAR imaging of complex moving targets. First, conventional range alignment, phase compensation and range compression are performed over the raw phase history data such that each range bin can be modelled as the sum of several linear frequency modulation or chirp signals. Secondly, a modified-Wigner-Ville distribution (referred to as M-WVD) approach is proposed, which is based on a scale transform in the time-frequency distribution plane and can effectively suppress the troublesome cross-term interference associated with WVD via coherent integration. Finally, the azimuth ISAR image can be obtained via a simple maximisation projection from the two-dimensional accumulated plot to the azimuth dimension. Compared with existing WVD-based ISAR imaging algorithms, the proposed method has the following features: better cross-term interference reduction achieved at no resolution loss, computationally more efficient with no expensive two-dimensional parameter search, and higher signal processing gain because of coherent integration during the whole imaging time. Both numerical and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "New ISAR

Variations in the distance to the target cause circular shifts of the received signal, and most of the classification algorithms are very sensitive to shifts over the input signal. This fact makes the alignment of each signal prior to any classification stage very important. Here the alignment of noisy signals using the zero phase method is studied. In order to evaluate the performance of the alignment method, a theoretical analysis of the sensitivity to noise of this alignment method is carried out. As a result, an analytical expression that predicts the error of the alignment method is obtained. The validity of this expression is also confirmed by experimental results. A database of high-range resolution radar profiles containing patterns belonging to six different targets has been used, and a comparative study of the sensitivity to noise estimated using the profiles of the database and predicted by the analytical expression is carried out. The results demonstrate that the proposed analytical expression is useful to analyse the sensitivity to noise of the zero-phase alignment method for medium and high signal-to-noise ratio values.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Statistical analysis of the zero-phase method for aligning noisy high-resolution radar signals"}, "arnumber": "4723706", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T12:34:22", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4723699/4723706", "paperCitations": {}, "ieeeCitationCount": "0", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.023579S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Statistical analysis of the zero-phase method for aligning noisy high-resolution radar signals", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Statistical analysis of the zero-phase method for aligning noisy high-resolution radar signals"}}, "Article 10": {"details": {"issue": "1", "volume": "3", "authors": [{"name": "M.

The conventional model, which describes targets with manoeuvre, is based on the state vector of target position and velocity. The acceleration is treated as an additive input term in the corresponding state equation. The proposed method is a Kalman filter-based tracking scheme with the IE approach. The proposed model is a special augmentation in the state-space model which considers both the state vector and the unknown input vector as a new augmented state vector. In the proposed scheme, the original state and acceleration vectors are estimated simultaneously with a standard Kalman filter. The proposed tracking algorithm operates in both the non-manoeuvring and the manoeuvring modes and the manoeuvre detection procedure is eliminated. The theoretical development is verified by simulation results, which also contain some examples of tracking typical target manoeuvres. The results are compared with a traditional IE method.

More recently, MIMO techniques in radar have been proposed. MIMO is discussed in the context of high-frequency surface waves radar (HFSWR). After a short introduction to the MIMO radar technique (a technique which is not new; the RIAS developed by ONERA was probably the first MIMO radar), explores two different applications are explored. The first application aims at improving the resolution and accuracy of a coastal radar, proposed here in a bistatic configuration. Such a radar operates with a wide sparse frequency band and with an equivalent wide aperture, taking advantage of the MIMO configuration. Simulation over a congested area of targets demonstrates the benefit of MIMO over the conventional HFSWR radar, especially in terms of separation of targets. The second application consists in a more practical ship-borne HFWSR configuration compatible with space time adaptive processing (STAP) to improve the detection of slow targets. In this case, a limited number of receiving channels is considered whereas STAP uses the degrees of freedom offered by the transmitting array. The MIMO-STAP is compared with a conventional STAP, showing that theoretical performances should not be affected by the MIMO configuration even if the signals are no longer perfectly orthogonal, because of Doppler shift, once scattered by moving targets.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Improvement of high-frequency surface waves radar performances by use of multiple-input multiple-output configurations"}, "arnumber": "4723705", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:42:18", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/4723699/4723705", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "375KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6166463", "documentLink": "/document/6166463"}, "displayText": "R&#x00E9;gis Guinvarc'h, Rapha&#x00EB;l Gillard, Bernard Uguen, Jacques El-Khoury, \"Improving the Azimuthal Resolution of HFSWR With Multiplicative Beamforming\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters IEEE</em>, vol. 9, pp. 925-927, 2012, ISSN 1545-598X.", "title": "Improving the Azimuthal Resolution of HFSWR With Multiplicative Beamforming", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "824KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6964588", "documentLink": "/document/6964588"}, "displayText": "Xu Xing-an, Wu Xiong-bin, Pi Xiao-shan, Lu Xiong-jiu, \"Ionospheric clutter analysis and suppression in a distributed MIMO-HFSWR system\", <em>OCEANS 2014 - TAIPEI</em>, pp. 1-5, 2014.", "title": "Ionospheric clutter analysis and suppression in a distributed MIMO-HFSWR system", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1042KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6206599", "documentLink": "/document/6206599"}, "displayText": "U.

However, the problem of position finding in passive radar systems is somewhat different from the general case of sensor networks. Generally, in a passive radar system, there are few receivers located at short distances when compared with the it distance from the target. In this case, a problem known as geometric dilution of precision (GDP) occurs, which considerably increases the error of many proposed methods. This phenomenon can even make the position finding equations non-solvable. Regarding this fact, we have developed a least mean square error (LMSE) based method, which uses both the angle of arrival (AOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements to estimate almost precisely the position of very distant targets in a passive radar system. A simple equation is derived here to compare the TDOA and AOA accuracies. Then, it is shown that whenever the accuracies of these two measurements are comparable, the proposed method estimates the target position more precisely than the conventional AOA-only and TDOA-only methods.

The more detailed formulations of the ground clutter model and the signal model are given in a matrix-vector form. The least-squares-typical cost function associated with the filter coefficient matrix of the TDPC is established on the basis of the ground clutter model and the signal model. Like the classical displaced phase centre antenna (DPCA) processing, the proposed TDPC is also a spatial-temporal suppressor of ground clutter and can decrease the ground clutter signals, even though the DPCA condition is not satisfied. The proposed TDPC can also be used as an efficient pre-filtering tool before the conventional moving target indication (MTI) processing and the classical adaptive processing. Moreover, if only the TDPC plus the conventional MTI is used, it takes less computational time than the adaptive canceller.

The proposed technique emulates the behaviour of traditional motion target detection algorithms without the need for reliable Doppler information. It also constitutes a powerful non-coherent integration strategy of the target-s energy along its specific path on the range-time plot. The performance of the detection technique has been tested against real high-resolution sea clutter data, acquired at the south coast of Spain with an in-house developed continuous wave linear frequency modulated millimetre-wave radar system.

The statistics of the secondary data snapshots used to estimate the optimum weight vector are not identically distributed with respect to range, thus preventing the customary STAP processor from achieving its optimum performance. The compensation of the range dependence of the secondary data requires precise knowledge of the array response for any direction of arrival (DOA), and, thus, of the spatial steering vectors (SVs). The authors propose a novel registration-based range-dependence compensation algorithm that gives an accurate estimate of the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix under the hypotheses that calibrated spatial SVs are available only for a small set of DOAs, and that the errors in the model giving the true spatial SV for each DOA are DOA dependent. The performance in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio loss is promising.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Handling partially calibrated conformal antenna arrays in range&#2013;dependence compensation for airborne bistatic space&#2013;time adaptive processing radar"}, "arnumber": "5210023", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T15:46:22", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5210015/5210023", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "1553KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5494603", "documentLink": "/document/5494603"}, "displayText": "Svante Bj\u00f6rklund, Tomas Boman, Anders Nelander, Svante Bj\u00f6rklund, \"Clutter properties for STAP with smooth and faceted cylindrical conformal antennas\", <em>Radar Conference 2010 IEEE</em>, pp. 315-320, 2010, ISSN 2375-5318.", "title": "Clutter properties for STAP with smooth and faceted cylindrical conformal antennas", "order": "1"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "1", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.026478S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Handling partially calibrated conformal antenna arrays in range&#2013;dependence compensation for airborne bistatic space&#2013;time adaptive processing radar", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Handling partially calibrated conformal antenna arrays in range&#2013;dependence compensation for airborne bistatic space&#2013;time adaptive processing radar"}}, "Article 1": {"details": {"volume": "3", "publisher": "IET", "issue": "4", "doi": "10.1049/iet-rsn.2009.9041", "abstract": "This special issue is based on a selection of the innovative ideas and trends presently growing in the international radar community, as expressed by the contributions presented at the 2008 IEEE Radar Conference (http:// www.radarcon2008.org).

The experiment objective was to demonstrate that adaptive transmitter beamforming could be used in an appropriately design radar to reject spatially discrete Doppler-spread clutter. In the particular MIMO radar architecture that the authors call non-causal transmit beamforming, conventional or adaptive transmitter beamforming occurs following waveform transmission, propagation, scatter from targets and clutter sources, return propagation and finally signal reception. In the case reported herein spatially discrete clutter was successfully rejected to the noise floor of the radar return with rejection in excess of 35 dB achieved using common adaptive algorithms and straightforward training data selection. As part of the rejection algorithm the transmitted waveform direction-of-departure (DOD) from the transmitter array to the target was estimated and used as the preserved steer direction in the adaptive beamformer. The DOD estimates agree well with the geometrically determined true values. The demonstration of non-causal transmit beamforming suggests that it will be possible to create multiple simultaneous adaptive range-dependent transmitter beams with an appropriately designed OTHR. This has several applications including for the mitigation of Doppler-spread clutter.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Multiple-input multiple-output over-thehorizon radar: experimental results"}, "arnumber": "5210017", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-10T12:22:37", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5210015/5210017", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "2224KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6630044", "documentLink": "/document/6630044"}, "displayText": "Wei Zhang, Wei Liu, Ju Wang, Siliang Wu, \"Joint Transmission and Reception Diversity Smoothing for Direction Finding of Coherent Targets in MIMO Radar\", <em>Selected Topics in Signal Processing IEEE Journal of</em>, vol. 8, pp. 115-124, 2014, ISSN 1932-4553.", "title": "Joint Transmission and Reception Diversity Smoothing for Direction Finding of Coherent Targets in MIMO Radar", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "794KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6212247", "documentLink": "/document/6212247"}, "displayText": "G.

However, the CFA non-planar geometry induces clutter non-stationarity, resulting in elevated signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) loss when applying conventional space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms. Non-stationary clutter leads to covariance matrix estimation error and, consequently, an erroneous STAP frequency response. In this study, the authors examine two practical conformal antenna configurations: a belly-mounted canoe and a nose-mounted, chined shape. Using high-fidelity signal models, the authors show traditional STAP losses in excess of 10-dB because of the effects of clutter non-stationarity. The authors then investigate a number of ameliorating techniques compatible with standard STAP implementation, including localised processing, localised processing with time-varying weights, equivalent uniform linear array transformation, angle-Doppler warping and higher-order angle-Doppler warping. The authors demonstrate very good performance for the higher-order angle-Doppler warping method applied to the chined radome shape, with peak adaptive SINR losses reduced from nearly 16-dB for the uncompensated case to 3-dB of loss consistent with performance attainable in a homogeneous clutter environment. The authors also find good performance for three-dimensional angle-Doppler warping over azimuth, elevation and Doppler when applied to the tapered canoe shape, with uncompensated losses of roughly 14-dB reduced to 3-dB, again a level compatible with STAP applied in a homogeneous clutter environment. The authors thus show that CFA STAP can yield performance similar to that of a conventional planar array when using appropriate compensation methods.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Adaptive ground clutter suppression for conformal array radar systems"}, "arnumber": "5210022", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:45:54", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5210015/5210022", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "1553KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5494603", "documentLink": "/document/5494603"}, "displayText": "Svante Bj\u00f6rklund, Tomas Boman, Anders Nelander, Svante Bj\u00f6rklund, \"Clutter properties for STAP with smooth and faceted cylindrical conformal antennas\", <em>Radar Conference 2010 IEEE</em>, pp. 315-320, 2010, ISSN 2375-5318.", "title": "Clutter properties for STAP with smooth and faceted cylindrical conformal antennas", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2040KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6230203", "documentLink": "/document/6230203"}, "displayText": "Dan Sun, Wenbin Dou, Xuequan Yan, \"A broadband phased array system with cylindrical conformal antenna\", <em>Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT) 2012 International Conference on</em>, vol. 3, pp. 1-3, 2012.", "title": "A broadband phased array system with cylindrical conformal antenna", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "270KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5656256", "documentLink": "/document/5656256"}, "displayText": "Wang Yong-liang, Xie Wen-chong, Duan Ke-qing, Zhang Xi-chuan, \"General clutter modeling for airborne radar\", <em>Signal Processing (ICSP) 2010 IEEE 10th International Conference on</em>, pp. 2274-2278, 2010.", "title": "General clutter modeling for airborne radar", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "399KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6586085", "documentLink": "/document/6586085"}, "displayText": "Ryan K.

Specifically, the aim is the automatic recognition of ship targets from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images. For this purpose a new two-step multi-feature based technique is proposed; this technique uses a number of features extracted from the ship radar image and matches these features with those extracted from the images obtained by properly projecting the target models of the classification library. Both cases of a priori known or unknown ship aspect angles are considered: the knowledge of the ship aspect (as available from tracking data) allows the selection of the candidate models on the basis of the matching between the ship and the model length, thus resulting in a performance improvement. Moreover, both single- and multi-frame-based processing techniques are proposed in order to assess the performance improvement achievable when an increasing number of ISAR images are involved in the decision; the fusion strategy adopted for the exploitation of the information from the multiple images is also described. The performance of the overall proposed technique is deeply investigated against simulated data. Results of its application to a set of live ISAR images of a ship target are also provided showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Multi-feature based automatic recognition of ship targets in ISAR"}, "arnumber": "5210025", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2016-07-12T07:30:48", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5210015/5210025", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "452KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7497261", "documentLink": "/document/7497261"}, "displayText": "Anna Kurowska, \"The preliminary survey of ship recognition algorithms using ISAR images\", <em>Radar Symposium (IRS) 2016 17th International</em>, pp. 1-4, 2016, ISSN 2155-5753.", "title": "The preliminary survey of ship recognition algorithms using ISAR images", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1494KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6586123", "documentLink": "/document/6586123"}, "displayText": "Fabrizio Turin, Debora Pastina, \"Multistatic passive ISAR based on geostationary satellites for coastal surveillance\", <em>Radar Conference (RADAR) 2013 IEEE</em>, pp. 1-6, 2013, ISSN 1097-5659.", "title": "Multistatic passive ISAR based on geostationary satellites for coastal surveillance", "order": "2"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "2065KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7272825", "documentLink": "/document/7272825"}, "displayText": "Sang-hong Park, Joo-ho Jung, Si-ho Kim, Kyung-tae Kim, \"Efficient classification of ISAR images using 2d fourier transform and polar mapping\", <em>Aerospace and Electronic Systems IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 51, pp. 1726-1736, 2015, ISSN 0018-9251.", "title": "Efficient classification of ISAR images using 2d fourier transform and polar mapping", "order": "3"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1995KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6523065", "documentLink": "/document/6523065"}, "displayText": "Csaba Benedek, Marco Martorella, \"Moving Target Analysis in ISAR Image Sequences With a Multiframe Marked Point Process Model\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 52, pp. 2234-2246, 2014, ISSN 0196-2892.", "title": "Moving Target Analysis in ISAR Image Sequences With a Multiframe Marked Point Process Model", "order": "4"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "743KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7053018", "documentLink": "/document/7053018"}, "displayText": "Keqiong Chen, Jianping Wang, Weitao Li, Chenghui Zhu, Bo Li, \"Research and application of variant granularity feedback recognition method based on maximal entropy and cloud-membership\", <em>Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA) 2014 11th World Congress on</em>, pp. 1944-1949, 2014.", "title": "Research and application of variant granularity feedback recognition method based on maximal entropy and cloud-membership", "order": "5"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "1683KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6699032", "documentLink": "/document/6699032"}, "displayText": "Patrick L.

Next, the authors consider the implementation of MIMO radar modes using electronically scanned arrays (ESAs). Specifically, the authors show how MIMO techniques, applied to subarray-based ESAs, can cause high grating lobes and/or reduced search rates.

Performance is evaluated based on closed-form solutions developed for the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for each of the localisation methods. These estimators afford insights into the relation between radar locations, target location and localisation accuracy. In particular, the means squared error of the BLUE is factored into a term dependent on signal and processing characteristics and a term dependent on sensor locations. The latter is referred to as geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). The best achievable accuracy for the coherent case is obtained, and a comparative study with the non-coherent case is presented. MIMO radar systems with coherent processing are shown to benefit from a gain because of coherent processing among sensors. This gain is referred to as coherent localisation gain, and it is proportional to the ratio of the signal carrier frequency to the effective bandwidth (a large ratio for typical signals). The footprint of multiple transmit/receive sensors results in a gain, referred to as MIMO gain, for both processing techniques. The MIMO gain is proportional to the product of the number of transmitting and receiving sensors.

The authors assume that an a priori (knowledge-based) estimate of the disturbance covariance <i>M</i>, derived from a physical scattering model of the terrain and/or of the environment, is available. Hence, starting from a set of secondary data, the authors evaluate the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of <i>M</i> assuming that it lies in a suitable neighbourhood of the a priori estimate and formulate this ML estimation in terms of a convex optimisation problem which falls within the class of MAXDET problems. Both the cases of unstructured and structured disturbance covariance are considered. At the analysis stage, the authors assess the performance of the new knowledge-aided covariance estimators both in terms of estimation error and detection probability achievable by a class of adaptive detectors. The results highlight that, if the a priori knowledge is reliable, satisfactory levels of performance can be achieved with considerably less training data than those exploited by conventional algorithms.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Knowledge-aided covariance matrix estimation: a MAXDET approach"}, "arnumber": "5210021", "references": [],

Here, the authors discuss an experimental system in the high-frequency (HF) band, where due to long-distance ionospheric propagation of radio waves in the 3-30-MHz spectrum, the illuminator may be located well beyond the line-of-sight. In this study, live data was recorded by a high dynamic range multi-channel digital receiver connected to a two-dimensional (L-shaped) antenna array, and signals from an uncooperative HF over-the-horizon (OTH) radar transmitter have been captured and analysed. As a preliminary step towards the development of a general HF-OTH passive radar system, the scope of this work is to compare the performance of conventional and adaptive spatial processing techniques in terms of their ability to cancel direct-wave interference and protect useful signal echoes to detect a small cooperative aircraft target. In particular, an alternative adaptive beamforming method specifically tailored to this application is proposed, and its practical performance is compared with classical and standard adaptive beamforming approaches. GPS data measured on-board the cooperative aircraft provided accurate ground truth of the flight path, enabling target profiles in bi-static range, Doppler frequency and direction-of-arrival (azimuth/elevation) to be calculated as a function of time. This information permitted the different processing schemes to be evaluated with a high degree of confidence.

The clutter spectra not only vary severely with range, but also vary with bistatic configuration. The problem of range dependence is more serious in monostatic airborne radar. In this paper, the geometry of arbitrary bistatic airborne radar configuration is firstly analysed, and a formula for Doppler frequency calculation with the variables of azimuth angle and bistatic range is deduced, which is an efficient tool for bistatic clutter analysis. Because of the severe clutter range dependence, the processing of compensation is indispensable in space time adaptive processing (STAP). However, when range ambiguity occurs, the compensation is difficult to be applied to each clutter range cell. To solve this problem, a range ambiguity resolving approach is further proposed by utilising azimuth elements in phased array. Because this approach will result in spatial degrees of freedom (DOF) loss, the overlapped subarray processing is introduced in order obtain enough spatial DOF for STAP. By doing so, the compensation for mitigating range dependence can be applied effectively to bistatic clutter.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Bistatic clutter analysis and range ambiguity resolving for space time adaptive processing"}, "arnumber": "5260397", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-13T14:27:17", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5260390/5260397", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "903KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7535724", "documentLink": "/document/7535724"}, "displayText": "Yan Wang, Qing Li, Jin Fu, Guolong Liang, \"Resolving range ambiguity in long baseline synchronous acoustic positioning\", <em>Ocean Acoustics (COA) 2016 IEEE/OES China</em>, pp. 1-5, 2016.", "title": "Resolving range ambiguity in long baseline synchronous acoustic positioning", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "727KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663908", "documentLink": "/document/6663908"}, "displayText": "Liu Jinhui, Liao Guisheng, \"Robust space-time interpolation in presence of antenna element error for bistatic airborne radar\", <em>Signal Processing Communication and Computing (ICSPCC) 2013 IEEE International Conference on</em>, pp. 1-3, 2013.", "title": "Robust space-time interpolation in presence of antenna element error for bistatic airborne radar", "order": "2"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "2", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.033833S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Bistatic clutter analysis and range ambiguity resolving for space time adaptive processing", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Bistatic clutter analysis and range ambiguity resolving for space time adaptive processing"}}, "Article 3": {"details": {"issue": "5", "volume": "3", "authors": [{"name": "X.

An algorithm for moving target detection and location is presented with an azimuth-invariant bistatic multichannel SAR, which consists of one transmitter (channel) and multireceivers (multichannel). The algorithm is based on the discussion of the particularities of the bistatic SAR configuration including coherence improvement and clutter characteristics.

For a high manoeuvring target, the instantaneous Doppler of scatterers may be small at some imaging instants and the satisfactory RID images may not be obtained. On the other hand, a large instantaneous chirp rate is often present for the same scatterer at the same instant for RID imaging. In order to obtain some additional information of a manoeuvring target, a novel ISAR imaging approach, referred to as the range instantaneous chirp (RIC), is proposed based on instantaneous chirp rate of scatterer to provide cross-range resolution.

The relationship between parameters of the SF radar and the ghost images is provided analytically. A new synthetic range profiling algorithm is developed to generate HRR profiles without ghost images by using the least-squares (LS) estimation. For targets with negligible radial velocities, the new LS profiling algorithm can eliminate the ghost images successfully, and introduces less signal-to-noise ratio loss. With this algorithm, the restriction on the frequency step size is less rigid than the traditional unambiguous criterion. Consequently, a higher range resolution could be obtained.

For stepped frequency (SF) radar, the Doppler modulation is coupled with the stepped carrier frequency. It shifts and smears the high-resolution range profile and makes it difficult to analyse and extract the micro-motion information from the range profile directly. The authors propose to comprehend the SF radar as a special pulse Doppler radar, and the range profile as a Doppler profile for the convenience of motion analysis. The signature of moving targets for SF radar is analysed from this point of view and the equivalent instantaneous Doppler frequency (EIDF) is introduced. Then, a typical micro-motion, rotation, is taken as an example. The sinusoidal vibration of the peaks in the range profile sequence is explained in detail, especially the relationship between the sinusoid parameters and the rotation parameters. An approach to extract the rotation parameters from the range profile or EIDF spectrum sequence is proposed based on the Hough transform. Simulated and experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and the feature extraction method.", "link": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4119394", "title": "Analysis and extraction of stepped frequency radar signature for micro-motion structure"}, "arnumber": "5260395", "references": [], "citations": {"publicationNumber": "4119394", "publisher": "IET", "contentType": "periodicals", "nonIeeeCitationCount": "0", "lastupdate": "2014-10-07T14:18:44", "mediaPath": "/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/4119394/5260390/5260395", "paperCitations": {"ieee": [{"links": {"pdfSize": "1035KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6166878", "documentLink": "/document/6166878"}, "displayText": "Peng Lei, Jinping Sun, Jun Wang, Wen Hong, \"Micromotion Parameter Estimation of Free Rigid Targets Based on Radar Micro-Doppler\", <em>Geoscience and Remote Sensing IEEE Transactions on</em>, vol. 50, pp. 3776-3786, 2012, ISSN 0196-2892.", "title": "Micromotion Parameter Estimation of Free Rigid Targets Based on Radar Micro-Doppler", "order": "1"}, {"links": {"pdfSize": "151KB", "openUrlImgLoc": "/assets/img/btn.find-in-library.png", "pdfLink": "/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6159625", "documentLink": "/document/6159625"}, "displayText": "Rong Fan, Qun Wan, Hongzhi Zhu, \"HRRP synthesizing in presence of observation data loss: A new way\", <em>Radar (Radar) 2011 IEEE CIE International Conference on</em>, vol. 1, pp. 654-657, 2011.", "title": "HRRP synthesizing in presence of observation data loss: A new way", "order": "2"}]}, "ieeeCitationCount": "2", "patentCitationCount": "0", "mlTime": "PT0.03479S", "isEarlyAccess": false, "title": "Analysis and extraction of stepped frequency radar signature for micro-motion structure", "formulaStrippedArticleTitle": "Analysis and extraction of stepped frequency radar signature for micro-motion structure"}}, "Article 6": {"details": {"issue": "5", "volume": "3", "authors": [{"name": "J.
